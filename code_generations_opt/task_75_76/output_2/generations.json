It's asking for a \"proof\" that a is a product of 3 primes.\n\nI think you're right. I'm not sure what the OP is asking for, but if I were to take a stab at it, I would take the approach of writing a proof that a is a product of 3 primes, and then translate that into code.\n\nI think the OP is asking for the code.

The test for 3 primes is not very strong. The number 2 is not a prime, but it is the product of two primes. So is 30.\n\nThis is a common problem in programming. It is easy to test for a condition that is not very strong. For example, you could write a function to test whether a number is an integer.
