The article is about a mathematical algorithm. The implementation is not that clean.\n\nI agree. The code is not that clean. If I understand correctly, the author has tried to optimize the code so that only the n-th coefficient is kept. I don't think this is necessary as the article (and the math) has assumed the n-th coefficient.
