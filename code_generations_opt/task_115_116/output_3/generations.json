It should be easy to see how this algorithm does not run in the expected time (O(n^2) versus O(n) with bubble sort). The reason is that the bucket_capacity variable is not incremented by a constant amount, but by the amount grid[i][j]*i. This causes the variable to be incremented recursively, and eventually it reaches an unbounded value.\n\nWhen the bucket_capacity variable is incremented by the amount grid[i][j]*i, the bucket_capacity variable will eventually reach an unbounded value.

I'm curious if there's a way to do it in O(n) or better in terms of the number of wells, and/or to do it in linear time or better in terms of the number of wells.

If it can be done faster, that would be great.)\n\nIn the first example, each well is going to be full of water, and you're going to need to lower the bucket through the well to empty it.

I would have expected to see the bucket_capacity as an input in this case.\n\nI like how this seems to be a meta-algorithm, where you're describing the problem as well as the solution.\n\nI agree, that's a really nice solution.\nI've done a similar thing with boolean algebra. I was given a data structure and asked to determine if it was a complete list.\nI was able to recursively determine if a list was complete by recursively applying boolean algebra to the list.\n\nThis is the kind of stuff I love doing. I did something similar to this in college.\nThe interviewer asked me to solve a problem that was on a piece of paper, but he kept the paper from me.
