This post makes me feel dumb, but also happy that I now have a new tool in my repertoire.\n\nI don't understand why the author would use a list of integers as a dictionary instead of an array.\n\nAn array is one of the two most common ways to represent a dictionary. The other way is to use an associative array. This is a dictionary whose elements are themselves dictionaries, where the value of each key is the value of the corresponding key of the parent dictionary.\nSee http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array for details.\n\nUsing lists as dictionaries is a horrible practice. The underlying implementation (in Python, hash tables) can't detect when a key is a number or a string. In the case of numbers, the integer is interpreted as a key and the value is an integer, and the value can't be used for anything else. In the case of strings, the strings are interpreted as keys", "def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:\n    \"\"\" Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.\n    >>> string_sequence(0)\n    '0'\n    >>> string_sequence(5)\n    '0 1 2 3 4 5'\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return'' * string.from_iterable(n)\nThe string.from_iterable should not be needed here.

If you're looking for \"pythonic\" code, I think you are looking for list comprehensions.\n\nMy point is this kind of code is used far too frequently, is utterly error prone, and not at all pythonic.\nI'm hoping to point out that there are better ways.\n\nWouldn't list comprehensions be more prone to errors? You can't really write a non- error prone code that can handle any possible number of inputs, can you?\n\nWell, it's not just the number of possible inputs; it's the type of possible inputs.\nYou're right that this code cannot handle all possible inputs, but it is much easier to accidentally create a syntax error in the string_sequence() method.\n\nI think this code is", "def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:\n    \"\"\" Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.\n    >>> string_sequence(0)\n    '0'\n    >>> string_sequence(5)\n    '0 1 2 3 4 5'\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return '0', string_sequence(n - 1) +''", "def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:\n    \"\"\" Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.\n    >>> string_sequence(0)\n    '0'\n    >>> string_sequence(5)\n    '0 1 2 3 4 5'\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    count = 0\n    while True:\n        n = str(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n        if n > 0:\n           count = count + str(n)\n    return str(count)", "def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:\n    \"\"\" Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.\n    >>> string_sequence(0)\n    '0'\n    >>> string_sequence(5)\n    '0 1 2 3 4 5'\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return \"\". join(', '.join(map(str,range(n))))\n\nThanks, but I'm still unsure what this is intended to do.\n\nYeah, I'm sorry it's a bit more complicated than it first seems.\nThis function takes an integer as a parameter and returns a string that contains the given integers one after another in a space-delimited fashion.</s>", "def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:\n    \"\"\" Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.\n    >>> string_sequence(0)\n    '0'\n    >>> string_sequence(5)\n    '0 1 2 3 4 5'\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    s = \"\"\n    for i in range(1,n+1):\n       s +='' * str(i)\n    return s\n\nThis code should be straightforward to anyone familiar with lists and dictionaries in python.  For those who aren't, it may be worth noting that the code is guaranteed to work correctly, because it uses no dynamic memory allocation. The code does not assume that the range 0-n is already in memory; it allocates space for the list, and each number is stored in that list.  The memory is freed when the list is no longer needed.\n\nThere is no type error checking in the string_sequence function. It is guaranteed to work for any type that can be converted to a string.\n\nExample", "def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:\n    \"\"\" Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.\n    >>> string_sequence(0)\n    '0'\n    >>> string_sequence(5)\n    '0 1 2 3 4 5'\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    # returns the index of the first number in the sequence\n    return 0\nThis is an extremely bad practice, as is, in general, creating variables without defining what they are.

So it needs to be an empty string, because that's how python will recognise when the number has been fully enumerated.\n\nThis is one of my favorite tools when writing a text based game.

If the list is empty, the space would be empty as well. So the output of `string_sequence(5)` would be `'5', '4', '2', '1'`.\n\nI love this, it's basically the same algorithm used in Python's \"list.sort\" method, but for str() instead of list.

I have many helper functions for it, including helper functions to create lists, dictionaries, arrays, and so on.  This one is a bit more complex, so it has more states than most of the other functions.\n\nThis function is called with an integer n.  It returns a string with the function f on the left and the number x, where x is the number of times the function is called, on the right.\n\nI know that I can implement this function in a bunch of different ways.  I want to know the most elegant", "def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:\n    \"\"\" Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.\n    >>> string_sequence(0)\n    '0'\n    >>> string_sequence(5)\n    '0 1 2 3 4 5'\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    r = \"\"\n    i = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n       r += \" \" + i\n    return r\nIsn't this a useless function?\nHow would you iterate through the sequence?", "def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:\n    \"\"\" Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.\n    >>> string_sequence(0)\n    '0'\n    >>> string_sequence(5)\n    '0 1 2 3 4 5'\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return'', [int(x) for x in range(n)] + '\n    '\n\nI really don't like that example. It's a waste of two characters to put the \"0\" at the beginning of the string. Also, it's a waste of one character to do the same for the final character.\n\nSure. This was for the sake of brevity.\n\nI don't know what you mean by 'waste'. Do you mean that those two characters were taken out of the alphabet?\n\nNo. But these are not tokens that are meaningful in the language of sequences of digits.\n\nThe use of an empty string as a delimiter is really annoying when processing files, as they do not compose with other code.", "def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:\n    \"\"\" Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.\n    >>> string_sequence(0)\n    '0'\n    >>> string_sequence(5)\n    '0 1 2 3 4 5'\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, n: int):\n        self.n = n\n        self.sep = ''\n        self.pos = 0\n        self.left = 0\n        self.mid = 0\n    return''.join(self.sep)", "def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:\n    \"\"\" Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.\n    >>> string_sequence(0)\n    '0'\n    >>> string_sequence(5)\n    '0 1 2 3 4 5'\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    #print\n    return \"\\n\" + str(n) + \"\\n\"\n\nimport time", "def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:\n    \"\"\" Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.\n    >>> string_sequence(0)\n    '0'\n    >>> string_sequence(5)\n    '0 1 2 3 4 5'\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return '0 1 2 3 4 5 '\n\nThis is a great example of the fact that it's not necessarily always better to return a custom type when you could just return a string. I'd say this is a particularly good example because it's a one-off, non-reusable function.\nI wonder how many other functions in the standard library could be replaced by a call to string.concat.\n\nIts always better to return a custom type when the custom type is immutable. For example, if the user wants to take advantage of the as_string feature of built-in types:\n>>> 'a' * 'a'\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nNameError: global name 'a' is not defined\n>>> 'a' * 'a'.as_string()\n'aa'\n\nWhat does the second return value have to do with the custom type? It's the result of concatenating the two strings and returning the result. You can do that with a custom type.\n\nBecause its not a string, it has an as_string method. It is also immutable, so you can", "def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:\n    \"\"\" Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.\n    >>> string_sequence(0)\n    '0'\n    >>> string_sequence(5)\n    '0 1 2 3 4 5'\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return \" \".join(str(n) for n in range(0, n+1))\nWhat is the advantage of this over       string_sequence = \" \".join(str(n) for n in range(0, n+1))?\nSince this is python, can't we assume that the user will understand the `range(0, n+1)` part and not need to do it for them?  Also, I prefer the extra 1/2 line of code for the verbose version because I can just read it over without having to run it.  EDIT:  As has been pointed out, the code above uses `range` without `[0, n+1]`, which is a syntax error.\nUsing `range` without `[0, n+1]` is a syntax error, which would result in a compile error if you were using a `lambda`. I would strongly recommend using the `range` built in instead of `range(0, n+1)`, because the former is less likely to be a typo.\nIt's a syntax error in the code you originally posted.\nCorrected, thanks.</s>", "def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:\n    \"\"\" Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.\n    >>> string_sequence(0)\n    '0'\n    >>> string_sequence(5)\n    '0 1 2 3 4 5'\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return string.format('%d', range(n))\nIf I'm reading this right, that's only one more line of code than a for loop, with the caveat that this will always be slower. Is there a particular reason why this is a common example of an inefficient pythonic solution?\n\nIf you are just iterating through the numbers, then I suppose you can use a for loop. If you are iterating through the strings, then the for loop is a horrible idea.\nIt's not meant to be efficient, it's meant to be readable and maintainable.\n\nThe question was about efficiency, and I guess I'm wondering if there's a downside to using the range function directly over string formatting. If you don't care about the performance, then sure, it's more readable.\n\nIf you're trying to do something where the order of the values is important, then the output of range is going to be unordered.\n\nAh, ok. I've never seen range used where order matters, but I can see why that's a concern.\n\nThe problem with range is it has poor performance if you are not iterating over an iterable object (as opposed to a collection of iter", "def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:\n    \"\"\" Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.\n    >>> string_sequence(0)\n    '0'\n    >>> string_sequence(5)\n    '0 1 2 3 4 5'\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return''*n+'\\n'\nI'm not sure if the title is a typo, but you should be aware that that is not Python. That is the C-like Python syntax.\n\nAh, I was not aware that there was a distinction between the two. I saw it online and found it quite nice to read. I've changed it to use the first style you suggested.\n\nIt's a great article. I've been looking into writing a much simpler web framework for a side project I'm working on, and I think this could be a good starting point.
