The first one is a list of integers.  The second one is a string.  If you want to use string_view, you should use string_view.join().  (string_view.join() is not the same as string.join() either.)\n\nThanks. I just checked the string_view docs. You're right.\n\nI really like the idea of a string as a sequence of characters. This could be useful for many things.\n\nYou can also use it to replace strings with other strings. For example, to replace a string with another string in a string (for example, to change \"a\" to \"b\"):\n>>> old_string = \"a\"\n>>> new_string = \"b\"\n>>> old_string.replace(new_string)\n'b'\n\nThis is exactly what I was thinking of when I said \"many things\".\n\nI'm not sure how this is useful?\n\nIt's not useful if you already have a string with the characters you want.\nIt's useful if you", "def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:\n    \"\"\" Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.\n    >>> string_sequence(0)\n    '0'\n    >>> string_sequence(5)\n    '0 1 2 3 4 5'\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"\n    return''.join(range(n))\n\nThis is a perfectly valid implementation of the method, but it is not the \"pythonic\" way of doing it.\nPythonic is not the same as idiomatic.\n\nYes, I know. I was just making a point that there is no \"pythonic\" way to do this, as the author of the blog post suggested.\n\nThere is always a pythonic way to do things. It's just not always the idiomatic way.\n\n\"Pythonic\" is a loaded word that has a specific meaning to a lot of people. You should be more careful about using it.\n\nThe author of the blog post is the one who is being imprecise.\n\nI agree, but that's not the point of my comment.\n\nI don't think you're right here. I think the author is quite right to say that a string_sequence method should return a string. The fact that the Python language doesn't provide a built-in string_sequence method is a red herring.\nThe Python language also doesn't provide a built-in append() method. Does that mean that any class that defines an append", "def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:\n    \"\"\" Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.\n    >>> string_sequence(0)\n    '0'\n    >>> string_sequence(5)\n    '0 1 2 3 4 5'\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return \"\".join(str(0) + str(1) + str(2) + str(3) + str(4) + str(5))\nThis is not a bad solution, but I would go for a list comprehension in this case.

It's not the most pythonic way.\n\nIt's a good way to learn the language.\n\nI think it's an interesting way to do it, but I'm not sure it's the best way. It's an example of using a lot of built-in functions, which is generally a good idea.\nHowever, it's not the most pythonic way because it is a bit of a hack, and it's not very readable.\n\nI think it's a good way to learn python. The way you write code in python is very different from the way you write code in other languages. You use a lot of built-in functions, and you use them in a very different way.\nI think the code is quite readable. It's not the most readable way to write code in python, but it's a good way to start learning how to write pythonic code.\n\nI don't think it's a good way to learn python.

The problem is that the language is not powerful enough to express what you want to express.\n\nI think this is a great example of the problem.

The problem is that the programmer is trying to express something that can't be expressed.\nThe example that's given in the article is a great example of a language that can't express what the programmer is trying to express.\n\nHow can you say that? The example given in the article is a perfectly good example of a language that can't express what the", "def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:\n    \"\"\" Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.\n    >>> string_sequence(0)\n    '0'\n    >>> string_sequence(5)\n    '0 1 2 3 4 5'\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return str(n) +'' + str(n + 1) +'' + str(n + 2)", "def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:\n    \"\"\" Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.\n    >>> string_sequence(0)\n    '0'\n    >>> string_sequence(5)\n    '0 1 2 3 4 5'\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return''.join(str(i) for i in range(n))\nThis is the sort of code that makes me hate python.\nWhy?  What's wrong with it?\nIt's not that there's anything wrong with it, but it's a pretty trivial example.  If you have a long list of numbers, you have to write a function to return a string of the numbers.  It's a lot of typing.  If you had a list of numbers in C, you could just do this:      for (i = 0; i < numbers; i++) {          printf(\"%d\\n\", numbers[i]);     }\nOr you could just do it in Python:      numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]     print numbers.join(',')", "def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:\n    \"\"\" Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.\n    >>> string_sequence(0)\n    '0'\n    >>> string_sequence(5)\n    '0 1 2 3 4 5'\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    n = 0\n    while n <= n + 1:\n        n = n + 1\n        return str(n)\n\nThe function is not very useful.\n\nThe function is not very useful for you.\n\nI don't think I could have said it better.</s>", "def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:\n    \"\"\" Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.\n    >>> string_sequence(0)\n    '0'\n    >>> string_sequence(5)\n    '0 1 2 3 4 5'\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n\nI have a feeling you can do better than this. You could use the builtin `range` function, which would do it like this:", "def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:\n    \"\"\" Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.\n    >>> string_sequence(0)\n    '0'\n    >>> string_sequence(5)\n    '0 1 2 3 4 5'\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return \"\".join(str(n).split(\",\"))\nThat's a really bad idea. You're creating an iterator, but you're not using it.\nYou don't have to use the iterator, but it's still a bad idea to create it if you're not going to use it.\n\nI'm not sure I understand what you mean by \"you're creating an iterator\". The string_sequence function doesn't return an iterator, it returns a string. It's a bad idea to create a string and not use it? I'm not sure I understand.\n\nThe string_sequence function returns an iterator. You can iterate over the returned iterator with the.next() method.\n\nAh, yes, you're correct. I was thinking of the string_sequence function in Python. In Python, the string_sequence function returns a string.\n\nThe Python string_sequence function does return a string, but it also returns an iterator.\n>>> s = string_sequence(0)\n>>> s.next()\n<string>0</string>\n>>> s.next()\n<string>0</string>\n>>> s.next()\n<string>0</string>", "def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:\n    \"\"\" Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.\n    >>> string_sequence(0)\n    '0'\n    >>> string_sequence(5)\n    '0 1 2 3 4 5'\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return \"\".join(str(n) for n in range(0, n + 1))\nThis is a very common error.  I think the issue is that the author has written a lot of python, and is just trying to solve a problem.  However, when you are writing a library, you need to think about the problem from the point of view of the user.  In this case, the user wants a string, so you should return a string.  The user doesn't care how you got the string, so don't make the user write code to use your library.\n\nI think you're right.\nI've been programming in Python for a few months now, and I just recently started to think about how other people would use my code.\n\nI find it interesting that the Python community tends to have such a strong opinion on the issue of returning a string or a list. I've noticed that in the Ruby community, this is a non-issue.\nI think this is because Ruby encourages the use of method chaining and it's very easy to compose a new method on the fly.\nFor example, in the ruby version of this example, the code would look like this:", "def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:\n    \"\"\" Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.\n    >>> string_sequence(0)\n    '0'\n    >>> string_sequence(5)\n    '0 1 2 3 4 5'\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return str(0) +'' + str(n) + '\n    '\n    def string_sequence_range(n: int) -> str:\n    \"\"\" Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.\n    >>> string_sequence_range(5)\n    '0 1 2 3 4 5'\n    \"\"\"\n    return str(0) +'' + str(n) + '\n    '\n    def string_sequence_range_exact(n: int) -> str:\n    \"\"\" Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.\n    >>> string_sequence_range_exact(5)\n    '0 1 2 3 4 5'\n    \"\"\"\n    return str(0) +'' + str(n) + '\n    '", "def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:\n    \"\"\" Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.\n    >>> string_sequence(0)\n    '0'\n    >>> string_sequence(5)\n    '0 1 2 3 4 5'\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"", "def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:\n    \"\"\" Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.\n    >>> string_sequence(0)\n    '0'\n    >>> string_sequence(5)\n    '0 1 2 3 4 5'\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return''.join([str(i) for i in range(n+1, 0)])\nThat's the wrong way to do it. It's better to return a tuple (0, 1, 2,..., n-1) with the nth element being the first element of the tuple. The space-delimited numbers can be extracted from the tuple.\nWhy? Because the tuple will be a single object. You can use it as a dictionary key or a list index.\nOr a list of tuples.\nIf you want a list of tuples, you can do that with a list comprehension.</s>", "def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:\n    \"\"\" Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.\n    >>> string_sequence(0)\n    '0'\n    >>> string_sequence(5)\n    '0 1 2 3 4 5'\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return n*' '*str(n)+'\\n'\n\nI have been using this for a while and find it very useful.\n\nI'm not sure why the author is using string_sequence instead of str.format for this.\n\nI'm not sure why I didn't see that earlier.\n\nYou could also use string_concatenate for the same effect.\n\nstring_concatenate is a little more complex than string_sequence.\nstring_sequence is more flexible.\n\nAlso, string_concatenate is Python 2.x only, but string_sequence is Python 3.x compatible.\n\nDoes anyone else think that the Python community should come up with a more intuitive name for this kind of thing?\n\nI don't think this is a Python thing.\nIn C#, the.NET string builder is called a StringBuilder.\nIn Ruby, the string builder is called a StringBuilder.\nIn Java, the string builder is called StringBuffer.\nI think this is just a string builder.\n\nI don't think it's a Python thing either.\nIn Java, the string builder is called StringBuffer.\nIn C", "def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:\n    \"\"\" Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.\n    >>> string_sequence(0)\n    '0'\n    >>> string_sequence(5)\n    '0 1 2 3 4 5'\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return'' * (n + 1) + '\n    '\\n'\n    # This is the actual function definition\n    def string_sequence(n: int):\n    \"\"\" Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.\n    >>> string_sequence(0)\n    '0'\n    >>> string_sequence(5)\n    '0 1 2 3 4 5'\n    \"\"\"\n    return'' * (n + 1) + '\n    '\\n'\n    # This is the actual function definition\nSo what's the difference?\n\nIt's like this:", "def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:\n    \"\"\" Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.\n    >>> string_sequence(0)\n    '0'\n    >>> string_sequence(5)\n    '0 1 2 3 4 5'\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return''.join(str(i) for i in range(n))\nI think the author was trying to show the use of a generator expression.\nYou are correct that this is a bad way to do it, but that's not the point.</s>", "def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:\n    \"\"\" Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.\n    >>> string_sequence(0)\n    '0'\n    >>> string_sequence(5)\n    '0 1 2 3 4 5'\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return ''\n    + string_sequence(n - 1) +'' + string_sequence(n - 2) +'' + string_sequence(n - 3) +'' + string_sequence(n - 4) +'' + string_sequence(n - 5)\nBeautiful!</s>", "def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:\n    \"\"\" Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.\n    >>> string_sequence(0)\n    '0'\n    >>> string_sequence(5)\n    '0 1 2 3 4 5'\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return''.join(str(i) for i in range(n))\nThe space-delimited numbers start at 0.</s>", "def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:\n    \"\"\" Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.\n    >>> string_sequence(0)\n    '0'\n    >>> string_sequence(5)\n    '0 1 2 3 4 5'\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return str(n * 2) +'' + str(n * 2 + 1) + str(n * 2 + 2) + str(n * 2 + 3) + str(n * 2 + 4) + str(n * 2 + 5) + str(n * 2 + 6) + str(n * 2 + 7) + str(n * 2 + 8) + str(n * 2 + 9) + str(n * 2 + 10) + str(n * 2 + 11) + str(n * 2 + 12) + str(n * 2 + 13) + str(n * 2 + 14) + str(n * 2 + 15) + str(n * 2 + 16) + str(n * 2 + 17) + str(n * 2 + 18) + str(n * 2 + 19) + str(n * 2 + 20) + str(n * 2 + 21) + str(n * 2 + 22) + str(n * 2 + 23) + str(n * 2 + 24) + str(n * 2 + 25) + str(n * 2 + 26) + str(n * 2 + 27", "def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:\n    \"\"\" Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.\n    >>> string_sequence(0)\n    '0'\n    >>> string_sequence(5)\n    '0 1 2 3 4 5'\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"", "def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:\n    \"\"\" Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.\n    >>> string_sequence(0)\n    '0'\n    >>> string_sequence(5)\n    '0 1 2 3 4 5'\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return''.join(map(str, range(n)))\n\nI am not a python expert, but I think the return value is not what you want.\n\nThanks for the heads up.

It is hard to write a function that takes a range and returns a string with a different formatting scheme than the one you would normally use.\nI'm not sure I understand. I don't see any difference in formatting between the two examples.\nThe default formatting for range() is to put a space between each number. This is what you get from range(0, 10).   The default formatting for string_sequence() is to put a space between each number, but not to have a space between the first number and the string. This is what you get from string_sequence(0).\nSo you can't use it to format a range of numbers the way you would use range?\nI don't know what you mean by \"the way you would use range\".
