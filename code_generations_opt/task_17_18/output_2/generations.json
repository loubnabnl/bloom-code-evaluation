I wrote one for my own use, and it's really helpful.\n\nIn my opinion, the only real problem with python's type system is that it's too easy to just ignore it.\n\nI've been working on a programming language that compiles to Python bytecode. It's called Pypy.\nOne of the things that makes it possible to compile a language to Python is that Python is dynamically typed.\nHowever, I don't think that dynamic typing is a bad thing.

A common one is parsing XML into a data structure that can be passed around.\n\nI would like to see an example", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef parse_music(music_string: str) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" Input to this function is a string representing musical notes in a special ASCII format.\n    Your task is to parse this string and return list of integers corresponding to how many beats does each\n    not last.\n\n    Here is a legend:\n    'o' - whole note, lasts four beats\n    'o|' - half note, lasts two beats\n    '.|' - quater note, lasts one beat\n\n    >>> parse_music('o o| .| o| o| .| .| .| .| o o')\n    [4, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4]\n    \"\"\"    return [i * 4 for i in range(len(music_string)) if music_string[i] == 'o']\n\nThis is a good example of how to write a function that is hard to read and hard to modify.\nThe author has a very specific and somewhat odd use case, which is probably why he wrote this. But if you want to be able to use your code in the future, I suggest you don't write it this way.\n\nI don't think it's that hard to read, and it's very easy to modify.\nI don't know how it can be easier to read.\n\nI think the point is that it's hard to read and modify for someone who doesn't know the details of your particular use case.\n\nI don't think that's a good point.\nThe same would be true of any function written in any language.\n\nI think the point is that the code is very specific to the problem and that makes it hard to read for people who don't know the problem.\n\nYou can find a lot of interesting things in the python standard library:\n\nI'm surprised there's no mention of the built-in itertools.count", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef parse_music(music_string: str) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" Input to this function is a string representing musical notes in a special ASCII format.\n    Your task is to parse this string and return list of integers corresponding to how many beats does each\n    not last.\n\n    Here is a legend:\n    'o' - whole note, lasts four beats\n    'o|' - half note, lasts two beats\n    '.|' - quater note, lasts one beat\n\n    >>> parse_music('o o| .| o| o| .| .| .| .| o o')\n    [4, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4]\n    \"\"\"    if music_string.find('o') == 0:\n        return []\n    if music_string.find('o|') == 0:\n        return []\n    for n in music_string.find('.'):\n        if n.find('o') == 0:\n           return []\n           n = n.find('o')\n           return [n[0]]\n\nThis is very cool, but I think you're missing something.\n\nThis is a common problem with the \"from typing import List\" meme.
