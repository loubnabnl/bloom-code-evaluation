You are given a string s and a string c, and you have to delete all the characters in s that are equal to any character in c. Then you check if the result string is palindrome.\n\nSo in your example, you would delete all the characters in s that are equal to any character in c. Then you would check if the result string is palindrome.\n\nI hope this helps.\n\n-H.\n\nOn Mon, Nov 21, 2011 at 12:14 PM, David wrote:\n\n> def reverse_delete(s,c):\n> \"\"\"Task\n> We are given two

It takes two strings as parameters and returns a tuple containing the result string and whether it is palindrome. The second function is the is_palindrome function. It takes two strings as parameters and returns whether the result string is palindrome.\n\nThe main function is the entry point of the program. It calls the reverse_delete function with two"]]
