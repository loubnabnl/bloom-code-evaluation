It's the global optimum.\nThe best solution is to use a divide-and-conquer approach. The standard algorithm for this is called the \"quicksort\" algorithm. It's the fastest algorithm known for sorting any list.\nThe problem with the divide-and-conquer approach is that it's not obvious how to divide the list into sublists that are small enough to be handled by the divide-and-conquer algorithm. In fact, there are a lot of ways to divide the list into sublists, and some of them are very slow.\nThe \"quicksort\" algorithm uses a divide-and-conquer approach, but it's a very clever divide-and", "def sort_third(l: list):\n    \"\"\"This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that\n    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal\n    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.\n    >>> sort_third([1, 2, 3])\n    [1, 2, 3]\n    >>> sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2])\n    [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    if l.count(i) == 3:\n        return sorted(l.values(), key=lambda x, y: x[i%3])\n    else:\n        return sorted(l.values(), key=lambda x, y: x[i] < y[i%3])", "def sort_third(l: list):\n    \"\"\"This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that\n    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal\n    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.\n    >>> sort_third([1, 2, 3])\n    [1, 2, 3]\n    >>> sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2])\n    [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return sorted(l, key=lambda x, y: x % 3 == 0)\n\nI can't help but think that there's a better way to do this, with a little more logic.\n\nThe problem is that the OP is using Python 2.x, and the function you've suggested is from Python 3.x.\n\nI think the OP's example is a little contrived.
