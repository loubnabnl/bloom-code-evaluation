For example, the above code returns 'xix' for 19, but that's not how roman numerals are usually written. The more common way is to represent 19 as \"XXIX\", with the leading \"I\" for 1 being a mistake in how Roman numerals are written.\nI was curious and dug up a source to check:\n\nYes, this isn't correct. The string should be \"XXIX\".\nThe reasoning is that the Latin word for 19 is \"novum\", so the roman numeral is \"XIX\" (one \"I\" in front, for \"i-novum\"). For 20, the Latin word is \"vicesimum\" (halfway between the Latin words for 10 and 50) so the roman numeral is \"XL\". And so on.\n\nI've been coding in Python for 15 years and I had no idea that it supported roman numerals.\n\nI mean, it's been around for 20.\n\nI'm not sure what you mean", "def int_to_mini_roman(number):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a positive integer, obtain its roman numeral equivalent as a string,\n    and return it in lowercase.\n    Restrictions: 1 <= num <= 1000\n\n    Examples:\n    >>> int_to_mini_roman(19) == 'xix'\n    >>> int_to_mini_roman(152) == 'clii'\n    >>> int_to_mini_roman(426) == 'cdxxvi'\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return 'I' + number + 'I'\nI would use a regex to make it more robust. For example, if you input \"twenty three\" as \"twenty three\", it would return \"xxii\", which isn't correct. If you use \"twenty three\" as \"twenty three\" and \"twenty three\" as \"23\", you get \"xxiii\" and \"xxii\", which is correct.\n\nI agree; although I think the regex could be a bit more flexible. You could make it handle 'twenty-three' and '23', while still being able to handle 'twenty-three' and 'twenty-three'.\n\nRegexes can be pretty easy to understand if you try to make sense of them in terms of their literal notation. In this case, I would write the regex as `\\d{3}` (instead of the more traditional `[0-9]{3}`) to mean \"any digit (0-9) followed by exactly 3 characters\".\nThis makes a lot of sense because it means that:\n\\- `twenty-three` returns `xxii`\n\\- `twenty-three` returns `", "def int_to_mini_roman(number):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a positive integer, obtain its roman numeral equivalent as a string,\n    and return it in lowercase.\n    Restrictions: 1 <= num <= 1000\n\n    Examples:\n    >>> int_to_mini_roman(19) == 'xix'\n    >>> int_to_mini_roman(152) == 'clii'\n    >>> int_to_mini_roman(426) == 'cdxxvi'\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return int_to_lower(number, 'n') +'s'", "def int_to_mini_roman(number):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a positive integer, obtain its roman numeral equivalent as a string,\n    and return it in lowercase.\n    Restrictions: 1 <= num <= 1000\n\n    Examples:\n    >>> int_to_mini_roman(19) == 'xix'\n    >>> int_to_mini_roman(152) == 'clii'\n    >>> int_to_mini_roman(426) == 'cdxxvi'\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    number = int(number)\n    return roman(number.lstrip)", "def int_to_mini_roman(number):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a positive integer, obtain its roman numeral equivalent as a string,\n    and return it in lowercase.\n    Restrictions: 1 <= num <= 1000\n\n    Examples:\n    >>> int_to_mini_roman(19) == 'xix'\n    >>> int_to_mini_roman(152) == 'clii'\n    >>> int_to_mini_roman(426) == 'cdxxvi'\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    number = int(number)\n    return u'' + int(number % 10) +'' + int(number % 100)\n\nReferences</s>", "def int_to_mini_roman(number):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a positive integer, obtain its roman numeral equivalent as a string,\n    and return it in lowercase.\n    Restrictions: 1 <= num <= 1000\n\n    Examples:\n    >>> int_to_mini_roman(19) == 'xix'\n    >>> int_to_mini_roman(152) == 'clii'\n    >>> int_to_mini_roman(426) == 'cdxxvi'\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    print(repr(str(int_to_roman(number))), end=' ')\n\nVery cool.

I wonder if there is any way to optimize the sorting of the string it spits out. I'm no coder though, so I may be completely off base.\n\nI don't think so. The only way I can think to optimize it would be to stop iterating once a string is found, but that's not really an optimization - just a different algorithm.\n\nI think it would be possible to build a \"search tree\" of sorts so that when you start iterating you can quickly find your target string and stop.\n\nNot sure, but you could probably do something like this with regular expressions:\ne = \"0|.|1|I|V|X|L|C|D|M|B|C|D|M|B|C|D|M|B|C|D|M|B|C|D|M|B|C|D\"\nr = e.search(number)\nreturn r\n\nI've done that in an interview for a job before.

But it's not so simple. If you use this, you need to define an roman version of each of your strings, which in many cases is a lot more work than it appears at first.\n\nYou need a function for each string?\n\n\"You\" need a function for each string.\n\nI like the name of this one: \"kotlin-flatmap-to-list\"\n\nI don't really get why the function is called \"flatmap\" in that case. That's a well-known term in functional programming and has a pretty specific meaning.\n\nWhat would you call it?\n\nflatmap in functional programming is a function that takes a function as argument and applies that function to all elements of a list in succession.\nI don't really know what the equivalent would be in this case. This function doesn't map anything.\n\nIt does map a function to every item in a list.\n\nI think the idea is that \"map\" is a pretty well-known term in functional programming and has a", "def int_to_mini_roman(number):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a positive integer, obtain its roman numeral equivalent as a string,\n    and return it in lowercase.\n    Restrictions: 1 <= num <= 1000\n\n    Examples:\n    >>> int_to_mini_roman(19) == 'xix'\n    >>> int_to_mini_roman(152) == 'clii'\n    >>> int_to_mini_roman(426) == 'cdxxvi'\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return ''.join(chr(ord(number)))\n\nYou have to admit that the corresponding python code is quite elegant.\n\nI wouldn't say elegant. I think he was just clever with using `ord` on integers.\nI'd say that the python code is succinct, which I would take over elegant any day.\n\nThe roman numeral problem is NP-Complete so there isn't an elegant solution that I know of.\nI'm not trying to say that this solution is elegant or anything, but just that the python code doesn't seem to come close to the python code that he's complaining about.\n\nIs it? If so, it's probably in the weak-ish NP-complete class, since it's a linear-time problem if the input is in base 10 (since you can just do 0,1,2,3,...).\n\nI'm not sure about this but I don't think it's that easy because it's only a linear time problem if the input is 10^n where n is an integer. It's not a linear time problem if you can only have 9, but not 8 or 7.
