The function is a generator and\nit returns a generator.\n\nThe question is why does it return a generator instead of a list.\n\nBecause it's a generator.</s>", "def generate_integers(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given two positive integers a and b, return the even digits between a\n    and b, in ascending order.\n\n    For example:\n    generate_integers(2, 8) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(8, 2) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(10, 14) => []\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return [a % b for a in range(b)]", "def generate_integers(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given two positive integers a and b, return the even digits between a\n    and b, in ascending order.\n\n    For example:\n    generate_integers(2, 8) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(8, 2) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(10, 14) => []\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return [a[::-1] for a in range(1, b) if a % b == 0]\n\nThat's not even that bad.\n\nIs there a reason why you have to use a list comprehension?\n\nList comprehensions are a lot more readable than nested for loops.\n\nThat's a matter of taste, I guess.
