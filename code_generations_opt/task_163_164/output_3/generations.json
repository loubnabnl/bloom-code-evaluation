It's just another way of doing the same thing.\n\nI don't really understand the point of this article. It seems to be trying to say that Python is hard to write in? I don't think that's true at all. It just looks like a lot of stuff about the language itself, without any particular point of focus.\n\nYour example is not very good:\nfor i in range(0, 10):", "def generate_integers(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given two positive integers a and b, return the even digits between a\n    and b, in ascending order.\n\n    For example:\n    generate_integers(2, 8) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(8, 2) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(10, 14) => []\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    for i in range(0, b+1):\n        return (i % 2) + (a - i) * b\n                      # floor division\n\nThe fact that the last line has a long comment that explains what it is doing is, in my opinion, the worst thing about it.\n\nI don't understand why this is bad? I personally like the idea of comments. As long as they are properly documented, they are a good way to explain why something is done a certain way. I mean, I use comments pretty liberally, but at least they're there for a reason.\n\nThey're fine in comments, but it's generally a bad idea to have a comment longer than the code it describes.\n\nThis is the kind of code you'd find in most Haskell libraries. The difference is that in Haskell the comments are always much longer than the code and you only get a small hint of what it does from the code.\nI personally like it.\n\nCan't agree more.

It is 1 line that doesn't even _look_ like a line of code. That's a crucial part of the technique.\n\nI guess I'm not convinced that \"looks like a line of code\" is a good way to classify code. \"Looks like code\" is different from \"is code\", and in many cases it's better to have a cleaner looking function that does one thing than a more complex looking function that does a lot of things.\n\"Code golf\" is a fun challenge, but in the end it's a bit like the 3-card monte game, and in the end it's all just smoke and mirrors.\n\nI am sorry, but", "def generate_integers(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given two positive integers a and b, return the even digits between a\n    and b, in ascending order.\n\n    For example:\n    generate_integers(2, 8) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(8, 2) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(10, 14) => []\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return (a, b + 2) % 2\nSo I tried it on a few numbers, and it returned the right output, but the algorithm seems quite slow.

I'm only curious.\n\nThis reminded me of an article I read a while ago about generating random numbers:\nIt's a pretty simple algorithm which was originally written in FORTRAN. This Java version uses generics and a random number generator to speed things up.\n\nI'd add the multiplicative identity to the list of integers that can be generated, since it seems to be a staple in these kinds of algorithms.\n\nThat's a nice little trick.\n\nI used to do something similar in C:\nIt's slow (in C), but it seems like it would be really fast in python.\n\nIt seems faster than the first algorithm I thought of.", "def generate_integers(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given two positive integers a and b, return the even digits between a\n    and b, in ascending order.\n\n    For example:\n    generate_integers(2, 8) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(8, 2) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(10, 14) => []\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    a, b = a, b\n    return int(b/a) % 2\n\nI've been using this for a while now, but it does seem like a somewhat clumsy way to generate a sequence of integers.

In python, an iterable is a container of objects, and is usually a list of objects, but can be a set, a dict, a string, or some other container.\n>>> list(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21)\n<list object at 0x7f3c57e0>\n>>> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,", "def generate_integers(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given two positive integers a and b, return the even digits between a\n    and b, in ascending order.\n\n    For example:\n    generate_integers(2, 8) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(8, 2) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(10, 14) => []\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n\n    def get_integers(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Get the even digits between a and b.\n    \"\"\"\n    while True:\n        if a < b:\n           break\n        a -= 1\n        b -= 1\n    return [a, b]\n\nIt's easy to see that, in the example, this code:\n    generate_integers(2, 8) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(8, 2) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(10, 14) => []\n   \nreturns 3, 4, 6, and 8 respectively.\n\nIt's also easy to see why this code:\n    generate_integers(2, 8) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(8, 2) => [2, 4, 6, 8]", "def generate_integers(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given two positive integers a and b, return the even digits between a\n    and b, in ascending order.\n\n    For example:\n    generate_integers(2, 8) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(8, 2) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(10, 14) => []\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    \"\"\"\n    def gen(i, n, c):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a positive integer n, return the decimal representation of i\n    in base 10.\n\n    For example:\n    gen(10, 10) => 1.0\n    gen(11, 10) => 1.1\n    gen(12, 10) => 1.2\n    \"\"\"\n    return int(n) + i % n + 1", "def generate_integers(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given two positive integers a and b, return the even digits between a\n    and b, in ascending order.\n\n    For example:\n    generate_integers(2, 8) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(8, 2) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(10, 14) => []\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    # given two positive integers\n    # return the even digits between a and b, in ascending order\n    # returning [] indicates that no such set exists\n    return [a[i:i+b-2], b[i:i+b-2]]\nIs this a joke?</s>", "def generate_integers(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given two positive integers a and b, return the even digits between a\n    and b, in ascending order.\n\n    For example:\n    generate_integers(2, 8) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(8, 2) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(10, 14) => []\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"", "def generate_integers(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given two positive integers a and b, return the even digits between a\n    and b, in ascending order.\n\n    For example:\n    generate_integers(2, 8) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(8, 2) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(10, 14) => []\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    for i in range(a, b):\n       return [i]\n    else:\n       return []\nThis is a pretty dumb way of doing it.  Why not just call sum(a, b)?\nGenerate_integers(2, 8) returns 2+8=10, which is wrong.\nGenerate_integers(8, 2) returns 8+2=10, which is right.\n\nBecause for the first case it returns an empty list, which is not what the user expects.\n\nThat's the point. It's a dumb way of doing it. There are many better ways.\n\nThis reminds me of the \"For Each\" in C#:\n\nNice, thanks for the link. I was just thinking about how I'd have to write a hacky workaround for this in C#, so this will definitely save me some time.\n\nI would have never thought this was a problem until I read the article.\n\nWhat I like about this is that the author doesn't just say \"dumb way\" and leave it at that. He gives us a good reason why it's a dumb", "def generate_integers(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given two positive integers a and b, return the even digits between a\n    and b, in ascending order.\n\n    For example:\n    generate_integers(2, 8) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(8, 2) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(10, 14) => []\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    for i in range(a, b):\n        return i % b\n    return []", "def generate_integers(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given two positive integers a and b, return the even digits between a\n    and b, in ascending order.\n\n    For example:\n    generate_integers(2, 8) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(8, 2) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(10, 14) => []\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    for x in xrange(a):\n        if x % 2 == 0:\n            continue\n             a = a % b\n              x = a + x\n              return x\n        return []\n\nThanks! This is exactly what I was looking for.\n\nYou're welcome. You'll be interested in this, then:\n\nThe use of the negative integer list is a little weird. If you're using the list as a container, there's no need to use the.append method instead of the.insert method.\nThe -1 and -2 cases are not handled correctly. They get their own lists instead of getting appended to the end of the list.\n\nThanks for the feedback.

It's a built-in function, so if you use it in the REPL it will be used on every invocation, whereas a while loop will be re-evaluated every time.\n2\\. The algorithm is in the closure, so the compiler can optimize it.\n3\\. The algorithm is one-time, whereas a while loop has to be re-evaluated every time.\n4\\.

If you are worried about performance,\nyou could use the C-style loop to produce the same output.\n\nFor the C style version:\nvoid generate_integers(int a, int b) {\nint result = 0;\nfor (int i = 0; i < a + b; ++i) {\nresult = result + ((a & 1) + b) % 2;\n}\n}\n\nI think the best version would be the C style, but with an inline\ntemplate function:\ntemplate <int A, int B>\nvoid generate_integers(A a, B b) {\nint result = 0;\nfor (int i = 0; i < a + b; ++i) {\nresult = result + ((a & 1) + b) % 2;\n}\n}\n\nYou're missing the point.\nThe point is that the pythonic", "def generate_integers(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given two positive integers a and b, return the even digits between a\n    and b, in ascending order.\n\n    For example:\n    generate_integers(2, 8) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(8, 2) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(10, 14) => []\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    for i in range(a, b):\n        return generate_integers(i, b)\n    return [i for i in generate_integers(1, 10)]\n\nyou're missing the point here.\n\nA function is a function, it has to be defined and it has to be used (as seen in the post). A function is not a \"method\" which is used to invoke another function.\nAnd the argument that using this function is verbose is IMHO totally not valid. Using the len() function to find the length of an array is also verbose, but it is a perfectly valid thing to do.\n\nYou are still missing the point. It is perfectly valid to use len(). It is also perfectly valid to use len(1). In both cases, you know exactly what is happening. It is also valid to call len(x) where x is a function, and len(x) may or may not do what you expect it to do.\n\nOf course you know what is happening. When you call len() you know that you will get the length of whatever object you have called len() on. So what's the difference", "def generate_integers(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given two positive integers a and b, return the even digits between a\n    and b, in ascending order.\n\n    For example:\n    generate_integers(2, 8) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(8, 2) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(10, 14) => []\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    if a < b:\n        return 0\n    return a-b+2\n\nThis generates a list of integers in the form {a,b}c. But it's not an\nordered list, so you cannot use the \"index\" or \"last\" methods.\nIf you want that kind of list, I suggest you write your own generator.\nIf you want an ordered list of integer pairs, use the sorted generator:", "def generate_integers(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given two positive integers a and b, return the even digits between a\n    and b, in ascending order.\n\n    For example:\n    generate_integers(2, 8) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(8, 2) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(10, 14) => []\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return [a[1] for a in range(2) for b in range(a)]\n\nNot only is the first version more legible, it's also faster, because it uses a for loop instead of a list comprehension. I don't think I'd ever use a list comprehension to generate a sequence, they're much too expensive.\n\nI'd like to see a benchmark on that. If the two versions are run thousands of times, I doubt the difference will be perceptible.\n\nNo, the difference will be perceptible, and it's also _extremely_ unlikely that it'll be on the order of a factor of 2 or more.\nThe list comprehension is roughly equivalent to:\nrange(a, b) for i in a: i[1]\nThe for loop is roughly equivalent to:\nrange(2, a + b) for i in range(a): i[1]\nRange is a natively compiled function, and its performance is likely orders of magnitude faster than the built-in for loop.\n\nRange will be almost as fast as a native for loop, but it's not as fast as you think.\nThere are two main reasons for the difference. The first", "def generate_integers(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given two positive integers a and b, return the even digits between a\n    and b, in ascending order.\n\n    For example:\n    generate_integers(2, 8) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(8, 2) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(10, 14) => []\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return [a % b for a, b in zip(range(a), range(b) + 1)]\n\nreturn None", "def generate_integers(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given two positive integers a and b, return the even digits between a\n    and b, in ascending order.\n\n    For example:\n    generate_integers(2, 8) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(8, 2) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(10, 14) => []\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    from operator import itemgetter\n    def itemgetter(i):\n       return i + 1\n    def sum(a, b):\n       return a + b\n    if b == 0:\n       return 0\n    if a == 0:\n       return 1\n    return sum(i for i in range(0, b, b + 1) if itemgetter(i) == 0)\n    print generate_integers(2, 8)\n\nThis seems to be a good example of code golf, but I don't know how to tell exactly.\n\nfrom operator import itemgetter", "def generate_integers(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given two positive integers a and b, return the even digits between a\n    and b, in ascending order.\n\n    For example:\n    generate_integers(2, 8) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(8, 2) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(10, 14) => []\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    if len(a) == len(b):\n       return 0\n    for i in xrange(0, len(a) - 1):\n       if a[i]!= b[i]:\n          return 1\n    return generate_integers(a, b - i, 2)", "def generate_integers(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given two positive integers a and b, return the even digits between a\n    and b, in ascending order.\n\n    For example:\n    generate_integers(2, 8) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(8, 2) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(10, 14) => []\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return [a % b for a in a...b for b in a...b if a%b == 0]", "def generate_integers(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given two positive integers a and b, return the even digits between a\n    and b, in ascending order.\n\n    For example:\n    generate_integers(2, 8) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(8, 2) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(10, 14) => []\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    for i in range(1, b - 1):\n        print \"%.2f: \", i\n    return b - a + 1\n\nIf you want to be able to input floating-point numbers, use int() instead of range().\n\nThat's just a simple implementation, it's not the fastest. The fastest one I've found is to iterate over the list of integers, and sort the list by the second (or whichever) integer. When the first integer equals the second integer, the list contains only the first integer. The list can be sorted in-place, so you don't need to do any temporary sorting (which is slow).\n\nHere is a python version that uses two generators", "def generate_integers(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given two positive integers a and b, return the even digits between a\n    and b, in ascending order.\n\n    For example:\n    generate_integers(2, 8) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(8, 2) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(10, 14) => []\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    print \"\\t\"\n    return [a, b + a % b for a in range(a)]\n    # this code works, but is quite slow, because of the for loop", "def generate_integers(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given two positive integers a and b, return the even digits between a\n    and b, in ascending order.\n\n    For example:\n    generate_integers(2, 8) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(8, 2) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(10, 14) => []\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    n = 0\n    for i in range(a):\n       n += 1\n       for j in range(b):\n        if i % n == 0 and j % n == 0:\n            break\n            a = i\n            b = j\n    return [n]\n\nThis doesn't take into account the possibility that a and b are both prime.</s>", "def generate_integers(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given two positive integers a and b, return the even digits between a\n    and b, in ascending order.\n\n    For example:\n    generate_integers(2, 8) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(8, 2) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(10, 14) => []\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    n = len(a)\n    i = 0\n    while i < n:\n       i += 1\n       a[i:i + n] = 1\n       i = 0\n    return a[0:i] + b[0:i]\n\nimport math", "def generate_integers(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given two positive integers a and b, return the even digits between a\n    and b, in ascending order.\n\n    For example:\n    generate_integers(2, 8) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(8, 2) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(10, 14) => []\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    if a == 0:\n       return 0\n    a, b = a + 1, b\n    return int(a / b) + (a % b)", "def generate_integers(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given two positive integers a and b, return the even digits between a\n    and b, in ascending order.\n\n    For example:\n    generate_integers(2, 8) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(8, 2) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(10, 14) => []\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return (i*2 for i in range(0, len(a)-1))+b", "def generate_integers(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given two positive integers a and b, return the even digits between a\n    and b, in ascending order.\n\n    For example:\n    generate_integers(2, 8) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(8, 2) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(10, 14) => []\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    # Extract the digits\n    digits = zip(*a, *b)\n    return [int(digits[0]), int(digits[1]) for digits in digits]\n\nThis is a classic _hack_, which is well done, but probably not the best way to do this.\nIt was probably done that way because it was the fastest.

But it is not necessary to do so.  If you wish to return a list of lists, then you need to change the definition of the function.  Edit:  Actually, you can leave the function definition as it is.

The naive solution generates an extra\n4 bytes in the string for each integer.\n\nI think the problem was not that the naive solution uses 4 bytes per number, but that it uses 4 bytes per number, and then tries to return them in ascending order.\nYou can do better by generating the numbers in a list, and then sorting the list. This will require a much smaller memory footprint.\n\nWhy do you need to return the numbers in ascending order?

The only constraints are that the algorithm must use the same memory size and run in the same amount of time as the naive solution.\n\nIt's not clear to me from the question that the memory size and time should be the same.\n\nThe question is to implement the algorithm as close as possible", "def generate_integers(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given two positive integers a and b, return the even digits between a\n    and b, in ascending order.\n\n    For example:\n    generate_integers(2, 8) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(8, 2) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(10, 14) => []\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return [a % b for a in range(2) for b in range(a)]", "def generate_integers(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given two positive integers a and b, return the even digits between a\n    and b, in ascending order.\n\n    For example:\n    generate_integers(2, 8) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(8, 2) => [2, 4, 6, 8]\n    generate_integers(10, 14) => []\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    for i in range(a, b):\n       if i % 2 == 0:\n          yield i\n      else:\n          yield i + 1\n    return [i]\n\nIf you're trying to learn Python, this is a nice exercise.
