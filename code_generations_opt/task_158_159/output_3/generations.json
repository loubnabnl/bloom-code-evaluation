The find_max() function uses the fact that strings have a maximum length of 255 characters.\n\nThe Python code is more verbose than the Haskell code because of the need to use the tokenizer.  This means that the Haskell code is more readable, since the user doesn't need to understand the underlying tokenizer in order to understand the code.  However, in many cases, it is possible to define a tokenizer which is easily understandable by the user, and which does not require the user to understand the internals of the language in order to understand the code.  This is the case with the tokenizer defined by the Standard C++ Library.\n\nPython has a built-in string type, so all these functions can be implemented directly on a string.
