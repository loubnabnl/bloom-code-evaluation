I wrote something similar to this, but I was very nervous and my interviewer told me that my solution was very clever, but not very efficient. He then asked me to write a function that would find the closest element to a supplied number, and return it. I wrote a very straightforward solution, and he told me that it was very clever, but not very efficient. He then asked me to write a function that would find the closest element to a supplied number, and return it in order. I was stumped, and I couldn't think of a way to do it in a way that was both efficient and readable. The interviewer explained that the solution was to use a dictionary. I was offered the job, and I turned it down.\n\nThere are a number of ways to do this. Here's a simple one:", "from typing import List, Tuple\n\n\ndef find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:\n    \"\"\" From a supplied list of numbers (of length at least two) select and return two that are the closest to each\n    other and return them in order (smaller number, larger number).\n    >>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2])\n    (2.0, 2.2)\n    >>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0])\n    (2.0, 2.0)\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return [(x, y) for x, y in numbers if x < y]\n\nThis is a nice example of a function that is easy to understand and easy to use, but is also easy to optimize. The author has done a good job of making it easy to read, but also easy to make it faster.\nThe first version uses a list comprehension. The second version uses a generator expression. The third version uses a generator expression with the more efficient \"yield from\" syntax. The fourth version uses a generator expression with the more efficient \"yield\" syntax. The fifth version uses a generator expression with the most efficient \"yield\" syntax and also uses the more efficient \"xrange\" syntax.\n\nI think it's worth pointing out that the \"xrange\" syntax is not a python-specific construct. It's a C-specific one.\n\nI think it's worth pointing out that the \"yield from\" syntax is not a python-specific construct.

In this case, a list is more flexible, but a tuple is shorter and easier to read.\n\nYes, and in this case the list is easier to read, because it has a special syntax for the order of elements in the tuple.\n\nI'm not sure I agree with that.\n(numbers[0], numbers[1])\nversus\n(2, 2)\n\nI agree that the latter is easier to read.\n\nI don't think you can do this in Python, but I like to use the following in C#.

The code is much more readable when you can see the types.\n\nI agree, but this is a fairly contrived example. I've never had a case where I had to specify the types of the parameters of a function.\n\nI use it all the time. It's a great way to keep track of things when you have a lot of parameters and you have to write a lot of code to do something simple.\n\nI use it too, but only when I need to, and only when it's", "from typing import List, Tuple\n\n\ndef find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:\n    \"\"\" From a supplied list of numbers (of length at least two) select and return two that are the closest to each\n    other and return them in order (smaller number, larger number).\n    >>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2])\n    (2.0, 2.2)\n    >>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0])\n    (2.0, 2.0)\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    for i in range(1,len(numbers)):\n        numbers.append(i)\n        for j in range(1,len(numbers)):\n            if numbers[j] < numbers[i]:\n                 numbers[i] = numbers[j]\n                 numbers[j] = numbers[i]\n                 numbers[i] = numbers[j]\n                 numbers[j] = numbers[i]\n                 return numbers\n\nI feel like the point of Python is that you don't need to import anything, and that this kind of code would be better suited for a library.\n\nI'm not sure what you're trying to say.

If it is, it calls itself again with the current number plus one.\n\nI think it's more clear to use the built-in functions.", "from typing import List, Tuple\n\n\ndef find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:\n    \"\"\" From a supplied list of numbers (of length at least two) select and return two that are the closest to each\n    other and return them in order (smaller number, larger number).\n    >>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2])\n    (2.0, 2.2)\n    >>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0])\n    (2.0, 2.0)\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    for i in range(numbers.length - 2):\n        if numbers[i - 1] < numbers[i]:\n            return numbers[i] + numbers[i - 1]\n        else:\n            return numbers[i] + numbers[i - 1]\n\nI don't get it.\n\nI think the idea is to use the range function to start at the beginning of the list and then iterate through the list, and if the first two numbers are the same, then return them.\n\nYes, I think the idea is to have a function that iterates through a list of numbers and returns the first two that are the same.

The range() function is a built-in, and you don't need to know how to implement a Tuple class to use it.\n\nI think he is trying to show how to implement a Tuple class in Python. But his solution is very bad.\nIf you want to know how to implement a Tuple class in Python, look at the official Python docs:\n\nI think the point of the article is to show how to implement a Tuple class in Python without using the built-in Tuple class.\n\nIt's a very bad solution, though.\n\nIt's", "from typing import List, Tuple\n\n\ndef find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:\n    \"\"\" From a supplied list of numbers (of length at least two) select and return two that are the closest to each\n    other and return them in order (smaller number, larger number).\n    >>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2])\n    (2.0, 2.2)\n    >>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0])\n    (2.0, 2.0)\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    for i in range(numbers.length-1):\n         if numbers[i] < numbers[i+1]:\n              return numbers[i+1], numbers[i]\n    else:\n           return numbers[i], numbers[i+1]\n\nThis is a very common idiom in python, and it is also one of the worst.\nThe problem is that it's hard to write a good generic version of this. It's easy to write a bad generic version of this.\nIt's a classic example of premature abstraction.\n\nI think it's a good example of using the right tool for the job. If you have a simple problem, use a simple tool.\n\nThat's what I'm saying. It's a bad idea to use a simple tool for a complex problem.\n\nI think you're overthinking it.\nThe list comprehension is a simple tool.

I am sure there are people who would disagree with me, but Python encourages you to write code that looks like English, and that is just not a good idea. The problem here is that the code doesn't even look like English. It looks like a Perl one-liner, but without the one-liner.\n\nI'm not sure how you can say that this code doesn't look like English. It's fairly obvious what the code does, and what the \"meaning\" of the code is.\n\nThe meaning of the code is not obvious. It's not obvious why the code is returning a tuple instead of a list.

If they're all the same distance, then the smallest one is the closest. If they're all different distances, then the smallest one is the closest.\nThe problem with this is that it's quadratic in the number of numbers. A naive implementation of this algorithm runs in O(n^2) time.\nA better solution is to use the \"greatest common divisor\" of the numbers.
