If you want to learn how to implement that in C, I recommend the book _Learning C the Hard Way_ [1] (The HARD Way is one of the most well-known tutorials for learning C).\n[1]:\n\nDefinitely one of the best introductions to C I've seen.\nI did a long (by my standards) stint in the C world back in the 90s, and I would not have been able to do it without a book like this.\n\nAt a certain point, one just needs to sit down and write the code for something like this. For me, there's a sort of eureka moment when the code is finally written.\nI would _never_ have thought to write a function like this. But, by the time I was done, it made perfect sense.\n\nI think that's the point of this tutorial - it shows you the right way of doing things, and then by doing it yourself, you learn the right way, and understand it.\n\nThis is a good example of a fundamental problem with teaching beginners how to program.\nEven if you are an expert in the language, it's not necessarily easy to write this function", "def by_length(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given an array of integers, sort the integers that are between 1 and 9 inclusive,\n    reverse the resulting array, and then replace each digit by its corresponding name from\n    \"One\", \"Two\", \"Three\", \"Four\", \"Five\", \"Six\", \"Seven\", \"Eight\", \"Nine\".\n\n    For example:\n      arr = [2, 1, 1, 4, 5, 8, 2, 3]   \n            -> sort arr -> [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8] \n            -> reverse arr -> [8, 5, 4, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1]\n      return [\"Eight\", \"Five\", \"Four\", \"Three\", \"Two\", \"Two\", \"One\", \"One\"]\n    \n      If the array is empty, return an empty array:\n      arr = []\n      return []\n    \n      If the array has any strange number ignore it:\n      arr = [1, -1 , 55] \n            -> sort arr -> [-1, 1, 55]\n            -> reverse arr -> [55, 1, -1]\n      return = ['One']\n    \"\"\"\"\"\"\n\n    return arr.sort()\n\nIt might be possible to do something more clever using a real sorting algorithm like radix sort. But radix sort isn't stable, so it can be dangerous to use it unless you know what you're doing.\n\nIt's also possible to use an existing module to do the sorting. The cmath module in Python includes both a stable sort and a radix sort.\n\nIn addition to sorting algorithms, there are also algorithms to count the occurrences of each digit in an array.\n\nSee also\n Counting sort\n Radix sort\n\nReferences</s>", "def by_length(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given an array of integers, sort the integers that are between 1 and 9 inclusive,\n    reverse the resulting array, and then replace each digit by its corresponding name from\n    \"One\", \"Two\", \"Three\", \"Four\", \"Five\", \"Six\", \"Seven\", \"Eight\", \"Nine\".\n\n    For example:\n      arr = [2, 1, 1, 4, 5, 8, 2, 3]   \n            -> sort arr -> [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8] \n            -> reverse arr -> [8, 5, 4, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1]\n      return [\"Eight\", \"Five\", \"Four\", \"Three\", \"Two\", \"Two\", \"One\", \"One\"]\n    \n      If the array is empty, return an empty array:\n      arr = []\n      return []\n    \n      If the array has any strange number ignore it:\n      arr = [1, -1 , 55] \n            -> sort arr -> [-1, 1, 55]\n            -> reverse arr -> [55, 1, -1]\n      return = ['One']\n    \"\"\"\"\"\"", "def by_length(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given an array of integers, sort the integers that are between 1 and 9 inclusive,\n    reverse the resulting array, and then replace each digit by its corresponding name from\n    \"One\", \"Two\", \"Three\", \"Four\", \"Five\", \"Six\", \"Seven\", \"Eight\", \"Nine\".\n\n    For example:\n      arr = [2, 1, 1, 4, 5, 8, 2, 3]   \n            -> sort arr -> [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8] \n            -> reverse arr -> [8, 5, 4, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1]\n      return [\"Eight\", \"Five\", \"Four\", \"Three\", \"Two\", \"Two\", \"One\", \"One\"]\n    \n      If the array is empty, return an empty array:\n      arr = []\n      return []\n    \n      If the array has any strange number ignore it:\n      arr = [1, -1 , 55] \n            -> sort arr -> [-1, 1, 55]\n            -> reverse arr -> [55, 1, -1]\n      return = ['One']\n    \"\"\"\"\"\"\n    print arr\n    print sorted_arr", "def by_length(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given an array of integers, sort the integers that are between 1 and 9 inclusive,\n    reverse the resulting array, and then replace each digit by its corresponding name from\n    \"One\", \"Two\", \"Three\", \"Four\", \"Five\", \"Six\", \"Seven\", \"Eight\", \"Nine\".\n\n    For example:\n      arr = [2, 1, 1, 4, 5, 8, 2, 3]   \n            -> sort arr -> [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8] \n            -> reverse arr -> [8, 5, 4, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1]\n      return [\"Eight\", \"Five\", \"Four\", \"Three\", \"Two\", \"Two\", \"One\", \"One\"]\n    \n      If the array is empty, return an empty array:\n      arr = []\n      return []\n    \n      If the array has any strange number ignore it:\n      arr = [1, -1 , 55] \n            -> sort arr -> [-1, 1, 55]\n            -> reverse arr -> [55, 1, -1]\n      return = ['One']\n    \"\"\"\"\"\"\n\nThat's a perfect example of the worst \"C\" code I've ever seen.\nNote: I said \"C\", not \"C++\".

This implementation _will_ work, but it will fail to return all the digits, which is the point of the original algorithm.\n\nI don't know what I'm missing, but this doesn't work for me.\n\nYou have to use _len(arr) < 9_ instead of _len(arr) <= 9_.</s>", "def by_length(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given an array of integers, sort the integers that are between 1 and 9 inclusive,\n    reverse the resulting array, and then replace each digit by its corresponding name from\n    \"One\", \"Two\", \"Three\", \"Four\", \"Five\", \"Six\", \"Seven\", \"Eight\", \"Nine\".\n\n    For example:\n      arr = [2, 1, 1, 4, 5, 8, 2, 3]   \n            -> sort arr -> [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8] \n            -> reverse arr -> [8, 5, 4, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1]\n      return [\"Eight\", \"Five\", \"Four\", \"Three\", \"Two\", \"Two\", \"One\", \"One\"]\n    \n      If the array is empty, return an empty array:\n      arr = []\n      return []\n    \n      If the array has any strange number ignore it:\n      arr = [1, -1 , 55] \n            -> sort arr -> [-1, 1, 55]\n            -> reverse arr -> [55, 1, -1]\n      return = ['One']\n    \"\"\"\"\"\"\n\nThis is awesome. So awesome in fact I've changed my mind about python.\n\nThis is so awesome that I am still confused as to why you were ever in doubt about Python.\n\nThis was a really good answer. It also demonstrates the use of the lambda function well.\n\nThis is great, but it doesn't seem to be a \"one line\" solution. You could just as easily use a for loop.\n\nIt's one line of code, and it does the job, but it isn't the most succinct way to write it.\nThis would be a one-line solution:\nreturn [name for name in sorted(range(9))]\nThat would be one line of code and it would work. But it's less readable and harder to understand.\n\nHow is it less readable? It's just a loop? How is it harder to understand? It's just a loop.\n\nIt's a loop, yes, but it's a less readable loop because it doesn't use any sort of comprehension of any kind, it just says to sort the array of integers, and then list the results. The comprehension version is much more readable because it tells you what's going on.\n\nI really", "def by_length(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given an array of integers, sort the integers that are between 1 and 9 inclusive,\n    reverse the resulting array, and then replace each digit by its corresponding name from\n    \"One\", \"Two\", \"Three\", \"Four\", \"Five\", \"Six\", \"Seven\", \"Eight\", \"Nine\".\n\n    For example:\n      arr = [2, 1, 1, 4, 5, 8, 2, 3]   \n            -> sort arr -> [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8] \n            -> reverse arr -> [8, 5, 4, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1]\n      return [\"Eight\", \"Five\", \"Four\", \"Three\", \"Two\", \"Two\", \"One\", \"One\"]\n    \n      If the array is empty, return an empty array:\n      arr = []\n      return []\n    \n      If the array has any strange number ignore it:\n      arr = [1, -1 , 55] \n            -> sort arr -> [-1, 1, 55]\n            -> reverse arr -> [55, 1, -1]\n      return = ['One']\n    \"\"\"\"\"\"\n\nI know that this is a good exercise and all, but the exercise is misleading.

The task is even more difficult if the items need to be sorted by multiple criteria. The simple solution is to sort the array and then to select the items from the array in a specified order. The problem is that we may need to repeat the sorting and the selecting for each item. This is where the solution given by  comes in handy. This function sorts an array of integers between 1 and 9 inclusive, sorts the resulting array, and then reverses the array. The result is the sorted array with the items in the desired order.\n\nThe idea of the above solution is to split the problem in two parts. The first part sorts the items. The second part selects the items in the correct order.\n\nThe sorting algorithm is straightforward and is given as an example in the introduction section of the article. The sorting function returns the sorted array. It is then used in the selection part.\n\nThe selection part is based on a simple idea. Given the sorted array, simply iterate over the items, and select the items with a given index that is less than the current index by one.

But I still prefer Python...\n\nIt is not a shorter way, but it is a way that has certain advantages:\n1) It can be done in a single line. In Python you'd have to put a while loop around the whole thing.\n2) It's easy to read and understand. The Python solution looks like a page of code that's been cut and pasted together.\n\nI think Python's for loop is probably the most elegant thing I have ever seen in any programming language. I have heard it being described as \"almost a mathematical definition\".\n\nHaving done more than my fair share of C++, I think the (C) 'for' loop is much nicer than the Python one. I know this is likely to be a very unpopular opinion, but it's mine.\n\nI don't think you're in the minority, the Python for-loop is rather obscure to the casual reader.\n\nAs someone who uses Python for work and C++ for fun, I find the Python for loop more intuitive than the C++ version.", "def by_length(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given an array of integers, sort the integers that are between 1 and 9 inclusive,\n    reverse the resulting array, and then replace each digit by its corresponding name from\n    \"One\", \"Two\", \"Three\", \"Four\", \"Five\", \"Six\", \"Seven\", \"Eight\", \"Nine\".\n\n    For example:\n      arr = [2, 1, 1, 4, 5, 8, 2, 3]   \n            -> sort arr -> [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8] \n            -> reverse arr -> [8, 5, 4, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1]\n      return [\"Eight\", \"Five\", \"Four\", \"Three\", \"Two\", \"Two\", \"One\", \"One\"]\n    \n      If the array is empty, return an empty array:\n      arr = []\n      return []\n    \n      If the array has any strange number ignore it:\n      arr = [1, -1 , 55] \n            -> sort arr -> [-1, 1, 55]\n            -> reverse arr -> [55, 1, -1]\n      return = ['One']\n    \"\"\"\"\"\"\n\nWow, that was fast.\n\nIt's a short snippet, in Python.

Could you explain a little bit about what is going on here?\n\nI've been reading about it for a few days. Here's what I think I understand:\nSome mathematical operations (like sorting) can be expressed as a function that operates on a list of numbers.\nOne of those functions is called \"map\" which, when applied to a list, gives you a new list where every item is the result of applying the function to every item in the original list. So, in this case, when you call map on the original list, you get back a new list of numbers where every item in the original list has been sorted.\nThe next function is \"filter\", which takes a function and an input and returns true if the input is in the function's domain. In other words, it returns true if the input satisfies the requirements for the function.\nSo, now we have a list of numbers. The only requirement for map is that all the items in the list are numbers.\nFilter takes a function, and a list of numbers. If a number is in the function's domain, the function returns true", "def by_length(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given an array of integers, sort the integers that are between 1 and 9 inclusive,\n    reverse the resulting array, and then replace each digit by its corresponding name from\n    \"One\", \"Two\", \"Three\", \"Four\", \"Five\", \"Six\", \"Seven\", \"Eight\", \"Nine\".\n\n    For example:\n      arr = [2, 1, 1, 4, 5, 8, 2, 3]   \n            -> sort arr -> [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8] \n            -> reverse arr -> [8, 5, 4, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1]\n      return [\"Eight\", \"Five\", \"Four\", \"Three\", \"Two\", \"Two\", \"One\", \"One\"]\n    \n      If the array is empty, return an empty array:\n      arr = []\n      return []\n    \n      If the array has any strange number ignore it:\n      arr = [1, -1 , 55] \n            -> sort arr -> [-1, 1, 55]\n            -> reverse arr -> [55, 1, -1]\n      return = ['One']\n    \"\"\"\"\"\"", "def by_length(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given an array of integers, sort the integers that are between 1 and 9 inclusive,\n    reverse the resulting array, and then replace each digit by its corresponding name from\n    \"One\", \"Two\", \"Three\", \"Four\", \"Five\", \"Six\", \"Seven\", \"Eight\", \"Nine\".\n\n    For example:\n      arr = [2, 1, 1, 4, 5, 8, 2, 3]   \n            -> sort arr -> [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8] \n            -> reverse arr -> [8, 5, 4, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1]\n      return [\"Eight\", \"Five\", \"Four\", \"Three\", \"Two\", \"Two\", \"One\", \"One\"]\n    \n      If the array is empty, return an empty array:\n      arr = []\n      return []\n    \n      If the array has any strange number ignore it:\n      arr = [1, -1 , 55] \n            -> sort arr -> [-1, 1, 55]\n            -> reverse arr -> [55, 1, -1]\n      return = ['One']\n    \"\"\"\"\"\"\n\nIt's all the same, with the exception of the handling of the empty array, which the author chose not to implement. The only \"trick\" is to use the dictionary-like syntax of dict comprehension in Python 3.\n\nInteresting that the first Python version uses dictionary comprehensions, but the second version does not. I wonder if Python 3 dict comprehensions are faster than the built-in sort function.\n\nIt's faster to use built-in sorting function in python3 than python2, but it's only a matter of a few microseconds. The dictionary comprehension looks much simpler though, I would say that it's worth the slightly slower time to save the lines of code.\n\n\"Array comprehensions are preferred over dictionary comprehensions since they are more flexible.\"\nHow so?\n\nYou can do dictionary comprehensions with arrays:\n[x for x in sorted(list)]\nand with lists:\n[y for y in sorted(list)]\nand of course, you can do a combination of both:\n[x for x in [list[:len(list)]]]\nThis is not possible with dictionary comprehensions.\n\nI don't think the author understands what the word \"preferred", "def
