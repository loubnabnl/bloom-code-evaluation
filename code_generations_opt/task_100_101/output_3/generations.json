The only one that would be useful to someone who would really be interested in this would be the make_a_pile function.\nThe others are just for fun to see if someone can get a job using this.\n\nI think the first one could be useful if you need to work on a project with an unmodifiable python version.\nI recently worked on a project that used python 2.5 but that was the only version the development server had. I used a lot of these for the libraries that we were missing.\n\nYou should try  It's pretty amazing.\n\nI have a lot of experience with SWIG, and it's a fantastic tool, but it has it's limits. It's great for wrapping libraries you don't control, but it's a lot harder to use it to add new functionality to a library.\n\nI think it would be more useful to use SWIG and some kind of Python->C/C++ compiler to generate the Python bindings.\n\nI", "def make_a_pile(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a positive integer n, you have to make a pile of n levels of stones.\n    The first level has n stones.\n    The number of stones in the next level is:\n        - the next odd number if n is odd.\n        - the next even number if n is even.\n    Return the number of stones in each level in a list, where element at index\n    i represents the number of stones in the level (i+1).\n\n    Examples:\n    >>> make_a_pile(3)\n    [3, 5, 7]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\nn=input(\"How many stones to make?\")", "def make_a_pile(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a positive integer n, you have to make a pile of n levels of stones.\n    The first level has n stones.\n    The number of stones in the next level is:\n        - the next odd number if n is odd.\n        - the next even number if n is even.\n    Return the number of stones in each level in a list, where element at index\n    i represents the number of stones in the level (i+1).\n\n    Examples:\n    >>> make_a_pile(3)\n    [3, 5, 7]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"", "def make_a_pile(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a positive integer n, you have to make a pile of n levels of stones.\n    The first level has n stones.\n    The number of stones in the next level is:\n        - the next odd number if n is odd.\n        - the next even number if n is even.\n    Return the number of stones in each level in a list, where element at index\n    i represents the number of stones in the level (i+1).\n\n    Examples:\n    >>> make_a_pile(3)\n    [3, 5, 7]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n\n    # initialize a list and return it\n\n    return [1]\n\nThis is pretty close to the first idea that came to my mind.\n\nYou're telling the guy to use recursion and then return the result?\n\nYes. At least as a challenge to your ability to use recursion.\nAlso, he didn't specify the algorithm, which means I could have given\nhim a recursive algorithm to implement.\n\nIf I hadn't been in a rush, I would have written a non-recursive version of the algorithm and left out the call to make_a_pile, then hinted at the recursive solution in the comments.\n\nHeh, I did that on a test once. I knew a recursive solution was the right one, and I was feeling lazy, so I just wrote the non-recursive one and left out the call to make_a_pile. My professor returned it and said \"You can make this recursive, right?

If you have ever played the board game Mastermind, this should look very familiar.  The make_a_pile function takes the number n as an input, and outputs a list of n numbers in increasing order.  Each of these numbers represents the number of stones in a level of the pile.  This process is repeated for n levels, for a total of n+1 output values.  The make_a_pile function uses a function called range() to get the next number in the list.  range() works on any iterable, which is basically a container that can be iterated over.  In this case, the iterable is a list.  range() returns the next item in the list, or -1 if the item does not exist.\n\nNote: The range function does not return the last item in the list (i.e. -1).\n\nThe above code can be easily tested using a basic Python shell:\n>>> python main.py\n3\n5\n7\n\nThe complete source code for this example is shown", "def make_a_pile(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a positive integer n, you have to make a pile of n levels of stones.\n    The first level has n stones.\n    The number of stones in the next level is:\n        - the next odd number if n is odd.\n        - the next even number if n is even.\n    Return the number of stones in each level in a list, where element at index\n    i represents the number of stones in the level (i+1).\n\n    Examples:\n    >>> make_a_pile(3)\n    [3, 5, 7]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"", "def make_a_pile(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a positive integer n, you have to make a pile of n levels of stones.\n    The first level has n stones.\n    The number of stones in the next level is:\n        - the next odd number if n is odd.\n        - the next even number if n is even.\n    Return the number of stones in each level in a list, where element at index\n    i represents the number of stones in the level (i+1).\n\n    Examples:\n    >>> make_a_pile(3)\n    [3, 5, 7]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    # The core of the function\n    def make_a_pile(n):\n    return [n for n in range(2, n + 1)]\n    if n == 0:\n       return []\n\nThe word \"def\" is the biggest thing in the code that is not actually doing anything.\n\nIt's also unnecessary.
