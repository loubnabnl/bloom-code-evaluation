If you want to do a for loop with a single line of code, you need to know about the internals of Python's for loop.\n\nI'm a python newbie, but I don't see why you need to know anything about Python internals to do a for loop in a single line of code.

It's not any more readable than a regular for loop, and it's less efficient.\n\nI'm not sure about the readability, but I think it's a little bit more efficient.\n\nIt's not more efficient.

The problem is that it's a terrible idea.\n\nThis is really cool! I'm curious if there's a more succinct way to do this.\n\nNot in Python, I'm afraid. There are a couple of libraries that do this in a more compact way, though:\n\nI'm not a Python programmer, but", "def encode_cyclic(s: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    returns encoded string by cycling groups of three characters.\n    \"\"\"\n    # split string to groups.

I think it would be better to use a table, something like this:\n\n[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F]\n\nThen you just cycle through the table until you get to the end, and you have the string encoded.\n\nThe next problem is that it doesn't work with punctuation.
