A data stream (the message) is encoded by a mathematical function (usually a hash function), and then the encoded message is transmitted. If the encoded message is received without errors, then the receiver can use the same function to decode the message. In the event that the encoded message is received with errors, the receiver will receive an incorrect message. The probability of the receiver making an error in the decoding is the same as the probability of the encoded message being corrupted in transmission. If the probability of the encoded message being corrupted is small, then the probability of the receiver making a mistake is also small, and the message is", "def encode_cyclic(s: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    returns encoded string by cycling groups of three characters.\n    \"\"\"\n    # split string to groups.

Is there a way to use cyclic encoding to compress the above code?\nI am not even sure if that is a valid question. But the encoding function above looks like a code compressor and I would love to learn how to do it.\n\nIt doesn't look like cyclic code could ever be compressed more than normal code, if it even could be compressed. The cyclic encoding is just a rearrangement of the characters; it's not possible to encode more information with it than you could have encoded with normal encoding.\n\nIt would be interesting if you could build a cyclic compression scheme that didn't use the string representation of the characters, but somehow used the actual values of the numbers and letters. But it seems like you'd need an infinite number of strings in that case to represent any single character, so you'd never be able to compress it more than regular encoding.\n\nI think the title of this post is a little bit", "def encode_cyclic(s: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    returns encoded string by cycling groups of three characters.\n    \"\"\"\n    # split string to groups.

Your second post looks like a strange coding style. It also is not compilable with Python 2.7.3.\n\nEdit: My example works with Python 2.7.3.
