Should one use indentation or spaces?  Should one use double quotes or single quotes?  There is also a debate about the proper use of comments.  Some programmers think that comments are a sign of weakness and that it is unnecessary to explain what a program does.  Other programmers write comments as often as they possibly can.\n\nA frequent topic of debate is the use of white space versus tabs.  Some programmers are religious about their use of spaces, while others are religious about their use of tabs.  What some people don't realize is that the debate is largely irrelevant.  A tab character is equivalent to eight spaces.  Whether you use spaces or tabs is your own choice, and nobody is right or wrong.
