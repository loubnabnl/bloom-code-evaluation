I have a hard time understanding how the resulting code is more readable than the code of the class itself. I don't see how this could be a good thing.\n\nIt allows the class to be more generic. It also allows you to add methods to a class without adding a whole new class.\n\nSure, it can be used to add methods to a class. But that's not what you're doing, is it? You're not adding a method to the class, you're adding a whole new class.\n\nI'm not sure where you're going with this.
