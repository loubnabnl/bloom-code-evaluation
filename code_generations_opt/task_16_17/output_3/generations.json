If you have a string with the letters a, b, c, e, f, and g, and you remove the letter c, then the string is still equal to abefg, even though you have removed one of the distinct characters.\n\nYou could use the Levenshtein distance to get the count of distinct characters.\n\nIf you use the Levenshtein distance, your algorithm will not work if you have a string that contains all the same characters (e.g., \"ABBCC\"). That's a somewhat rare case, but not unheard of.\n\nUnless I'm missing something, that's not true. Levenshtein distance can be defined in the regular case by computing the edit distance of the concatenated strings, and then taking the log of it. I don't see why that wouldn't work in the all-same case.\n\nI'll quote a comment I made to a similar post a while back:\nThe Levenshtein distance isn't the same as the edit distance of the concatenated strings.\n\nAh, my apologies. I'm used to it being defined as the edit distance of", "def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:\n    \"\"\" Given a string, find out how many distinct characters (regardless of case) does it consist of\n    >>> count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ')\n    3\n    >>> count_distinct_characters('Jerry')\n    4\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    # remove all punctuation (spaces, tabs, newlines, etc)\n    for c in string.split():\n        if c.isalpha():\n           c = c.upper()\n           # punctuation\n           else:\n            c = c.lower()\n            return c\n\nthe \"newline\" in the original is part of the string, not a punctuation.\n\nThe last example I tried (a very long string) gave the wrong result, suggesting that it doesn't handle long strings.\n\nIt's not a regex, it's a string. How long are we talking?\n\nThis is true in Python, but if the string contains a newline, it might not be true in C++, so the code probably needs to be wrapped in a regex to handle all cases.</s>", "def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:\n    \"\"\" Given a string, find out how many distinct characters (regardless of case) does it consist of\n    >>> count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ')\n    3\n    >>> count_distinct_characters('Jerry')\n    4\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    count = 0\n    for c in string:\n        if c not in count:\n          count += 1\n    return count\nThis is a terrible idea.

I think it might be because it uses string concatenation, instead of just using the index of the last character. I am probably wrong though.\n\nIt's wrong because the length of the string changes as you remove characters.\nIf the last character is a new line, the length of the string will decrease.\n\nRight. Which is why I said I was probably wrong.\n\nIt's not wrong.
