I'm pointing out that the solution given by the OP doesn't follow the spirit of the exercise.\n\nI think it's a bit of a stretch to say that it doesn't follow the spirit of the exercise. The spirit of the exercise is to show that you can write a program to do something that is a reasonable problem, but not a real world problem.\n\nI think the spirit", "def fizz_buzz(n: int):\n    \"\"\"Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.\n    >>> fizz_buzz(50)\n    0\n    >>> fizz_buzz(78)\n    2\n    >>> fizz_buzz(79)\n    3\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return (n%11) + (n%13)\n\nThe test suite for this solution is too long. I can't believe they're going to have to maintain this code for the rest of their lives.\n\nI think you missed the point of the exercise.\n\nI think the point of the exercise was to write a short test suite.\n\nI think the point was to write a solution that would be difficult to maintain.\n\nIt's not just about writing a solution that's difficult to maintain, it's about writing a solution that's difficult to maintain that passes the test suite.\n\nI think the point was to write a solution that would be difficult to maintain and pass the test suite.\n\nI think the point was to write a solution that would be difficult to maintain and pass the test suite, and to write a short test suite for that solution.\n\nI think the point was to write a solution that would be difficult to maintain and pass the test suite, and to write a short test suite for that solution, and to write a short test suite for that solution, and to write a short test suite for that solution, and to write a short test suite for that solution, and to write a", "def fizz_buzz(n: int):\n    \"\"\"Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.\n    >>> fizz_buzz(50)\n    0\n    >>> fizz_buzz(78)\n    2\n    >>> fizz_buzz(79)\n    3\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, n: int):\n         self.n = n\n         self.buzz = 0\n         self.buzz_count = 0\n    def fizz(self):\n         for i in range(0, n):\n            if n % i == 0:\n                self.buzz = 1\n                self.buzz_count += 1\n             return\n    def buzz(self):\n          for i in range(0, n):\n               if n % i == 0:\n                   self.buzz = 1", "def fizz_buzz(n: int):\n    \"\"\"Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.\n    >>> fizz_buzz(50)\n    0\n    >>> fizz_buzz(78)\n    2\n    >>> fizz_buzz(79)\n    3\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    else:\n        return n - 1", "def fizz_buzz(n: int):\n    \"\"\"Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.\n    >>> fizz_buzz(50)\n    0\n    >>> fizz_buzz(78)\n    2\n    >>> fizz_buzz(79)\n    3\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return n == 0? 0 : n == 1? 1 : n == 2? 2 : n == 3? 3 : n == 4? 4 : n == 5? 5 : n == 6? 6 : n == 7? 7 : n\n\nI'm not sure that's the best way to implement this.\n\nThe proper way to implement this is to use a recursive function.\n\nA better way to do this is to write a program that outputs the numbers 1-100, then ask someone to input the number of times that the number 7 appears in those numbers.\n\nThis is the way I would do it:", "def fizz_buzz(n: int):\n    \"\"\"Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.\n    >>> fizz_buzz(50)\n    0\n    >>> fizz_buzz(78)\n    2\n    >>> fizz_buzz(79)\n    3\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    def div_by(x: int):\n    \"\"\"Return True if x is divisible by 11 or 13.\"\"\"\n    return x % 11 == 0 or x % 13 == 0\n    def fizz_buzz(n: int):\n    \"\"\"Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.\n    >>> fizz_buzz(50)\n    0\n    >>> fizz_buzz(78)\n    2\n    >>> fizz_buzz(79)\n    3\n    \"\"\"\n    def div_by(x: int):\n    \"\"\"Return True if x is divisible by 11 or 13.\"\"\"\n    return x % 11 == 0 or x % 13 == 0\n    def fizz_buzz(n: int):\n    \"\"\"Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.\n    >>> fizz_buzz(50)", "def fizz_buzz(n: int):\n    \"\"\"Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.\n    >>> fizz_buzz(50)\n    0\n    >>> fizz_buzz(78)\n    2\n    >>> fizz_buzz(79)\n    3\n    \"\"\" \"\"\""]]
