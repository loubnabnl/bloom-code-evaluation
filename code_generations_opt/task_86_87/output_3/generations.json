I don't see why it's better than other solutions, like Markov chains, which are already written in Python.\n\nI've always been disappointed by the usual Markov Chain solution. The trick is to apply a \"generative\" algorithm and use a Markov Chain to \"probe\" the space.\nThe same technique applies to the \"Knapsack Problem\", which is also known as \"Minimax\" or \"Optimax\". In a Knapsack problem, you have an array of values, each of which has a weight, and you want to minimize the overall weight of the bag, while making sure that all of the values in the array are included.

These are organized in a way that you can get to the information you need by only going one level in the tree.

It doesn't sound like the author wants to rewrite the string in a different order. It sounds like he wants to take the string \"Hi\" and have it rewritten into \"Hello World\" in the same order, but the \"Hi\" is replaced with \"Hello\".\n\nI agree, this is how I read it, too.
