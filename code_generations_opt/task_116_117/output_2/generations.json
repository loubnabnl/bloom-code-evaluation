the problem and forget to break it down.\nI think the best way to approach it is to start with the input. What is the input? What are the constraints?\nThen you can start to break it down into smaller pieces.\nFor example, I would start with the input and say \"I have an array of integers, I need to sort them\".\nSo I have an array of integers.
