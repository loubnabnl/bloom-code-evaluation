For example, IEEE-754, which is used by Python, stores numbers in an 80-bit mantissa and a 23-bit exponent. (This is equivalent to a 52-bit mantissa in base-2, as the exponent is not part of the mantissa.) A single number can be represented in the mantissa as (for example)\n1.0 + 2.0*2.0 + 3.0*3.0 + 4.0*4.0 +...\nThe integer part is the largest exponent less than or equal to the largest exponent of the mantissa, and the fractional part is the exponent after that.\nIn the example, 4 is the exponent after which the mantissa wraps around, so 4^0 is 4.\n\nIEEE-754 doesn't support negative exponents (it's a 32-bit floating point format) so the largest exponent is always positive.", "def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:\n    \"\"\" Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into\n    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals\n    (leftover part always smaller than 1).\n\n    Return the decimal part of the number.\n    >>> truncate_number(3.5)\n    0.5\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n\nCan't that be done using integer division?\n>>> number = 3.5\n>>> number / 2.0\n1\n>>> number\n(1, 1)\n>>> number\n0.5\n\nYou're right, thanks for the suggestion.

I'm pretty sure that this is how the Float library in Python works as well, and I remember not being happy about that the first time I noticed it.\n\nThe problem is that it's not a \"problem\". It's a feature.\n\"decimal\" is a kind of number. So is \"integer\". When you give the number 3.5, you are giving the \"decimal\" number 3.5 (it is in fact a float, but \"decimal\" is a synonym for \"decimal floating point number\"), but you want an integer.\nThe reason that it's a feature is that it allows some very convenient things. For example, you can easily, and safely, add or multiply integer numbers, and always get a integer result. You can't do that with \"decimal\" numbers, since you might get something other than an integer. In fact, if you want to add a \"decimal\" number and an integer number, you have to write the result as a float. The same thing goes with multiplication, but then you can't always get the result in the same unit as the operands.\nIf you want the integer part, you need to", "def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:\n    \"\"\" Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into\n    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals\n    (leftover part always smaller than 1).\n\n    Return the decimal part of the number.\n    >>> truncate_number(3.5)\n    0.5\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"", "def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:\n    \"\"\" Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into\n    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals\n    (leftover part always smaller than 1).\n\n    Return the decimal part of the number.\n    >>> truncate_number(3.5)\n    0.5\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n\nThis is actually pretty hard to read and understand at first.

It has to deal with the issue of floating point numbers being arbitrary-precision, and the fact that some numbers might be too big to fit in a float. So it returns the largest integer smaller than the input, as an integer, and the \"decimal\" part is the fractional part of the input that's left after the integer is truncated.\nI think it's very well-written, because it's very explicit.
