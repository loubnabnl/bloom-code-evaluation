In one change, you can change one element to any other element.\n\n    For example:\n    smallest_change([1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6]) == 4\n    smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2]) == 1\n    smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) == 0\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    result = 0\n    while arr[0]!= arr[-1]:\n       if arr[0]!= arr[-1] and arr[0]!= arr[-1] and arr[0]!= arr[-1]:\n          result = result + 1\n    else:\n          result = 0\n    return result\n\nThe code is quite simple. It takes an array and tests if the array is palindromic. If it isn't, it checks if the first element is the same as the last element. If it is, it adds one to the result. This is because the first and last element of an array must be the same for the array to be palindromic.\n\nExample\nThe following code shows the use of the function smallest_change.\n\nimport numpy as np", "def smallest_change(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given an array arr of integers, find the minimum number of elements that\n    need to be changed to make the array palindromic.
