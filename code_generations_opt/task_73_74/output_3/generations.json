If you change all the elements to the other end of the array you get 0. If you only change one element you get 1. The function makes a change by simply changing the element at index j to the element at index j+1. If the element at index j is already equal to the element at index j+1 then no change is made.\n\nA similar algorithm can be used to find the maximum number of elements that need to be changed to make an array palindromic.
