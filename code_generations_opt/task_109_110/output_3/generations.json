This is because it uses a recursive algorithm, meaning it will recurse as many times as necessary, no matter how large the number is. A more efficient way is to use a divide and conquer algorithm. For example, to sort the numbers 1-2^32, you would divide the numbers into two groups:\n1-2^8 1-2^16\n... 1-2^4 1-2^2 1-2^1\n... 1-2^0\nThen sort 1-2^8, then 1-2^16,..., 1-2^0.\n\n2) It does not guarantee to sort the array.
