The first is that it's not really a solution at all. It's a _test_ of a solution.\nIt's a test because it's not clear that multiplying two numbers is the best solution. A better solution might be to add the units, or to divide them, or to add or subtract a constant.\nIf you multiply two numbers, you can get the wrong answer. For example, if you multiply 4 by 4, you get 16. But if you multiply 4 by -4, you get -16.\nSo it's not clear that multiplying two numbers is the best solution.\nIt's also not clear that multiplying the units is the best way to test for the best solution. For example, you might want to test that the correct answer is the same for positive and negative numbers. So you might want to test that the correct answer is the same for multiply(0, 0) and multiply(-1, -1).\nBut you can't do that with the solution given here.\n\nIt is a solution.

It's hard to write a generic sort function that can\ndeal with any kind of data. I can write one in Python, but it's\nnot obvious how to do it in Java.\n\nI can also write a function to find the nth prime number in Python\n(I used this example in my essay), but it's not obvious how to do\nthis in Java.\n\nSo, I would say that a language like Python makes it easier to write\nfunctions.\n\nI think the main advantage of first-class functions is that they\nencourage you to think about functions as first-class objects.\nIn a language like Java, functions are just another data type,\nand you don't think about them as first-class objects.\n\nPython also has some other features that make it easier to write", "def multiply(a, b):\n    \"\"\"Complete the function that takes two integers and returns \n    the product of their unit digits.\n    Assume the input is always valid.\n    Examples:\n    multiply(148, 412) should return 16.\n    multiply(19, 28) should return 72.\n    multiply(2020, 1851) should return 0.\n    multiply(14,-15) should return 20.\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    if b == 0:\n        return 0\n    else:\n        return a * b\n\nThis is a terrible example.

The article's code is a bit more \"Pythonic\" because it doesn't use the \"magic\" that the built-in math module does.\n\nI agree with you, but I think the article's code is a bit more off than the parent comment suggests.\n\nHow so? It's a little bit more verbose, but I don't see any problems.\n\nThe article's code returns a tuple, and the parent comment's code returns a single object.\n\nIn Python 3, you can use _ as a shortcut for the tuple.\n\nHow is this better than using the builtin module?\n\nI think it's a matter of taste.\nI like this because it's more Pythonic, and I can see what's going on.\n\nI agree with you, I don't think it's better.
