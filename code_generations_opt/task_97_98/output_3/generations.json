So, in a sense, we are using code to describe code, to describe the algorithm.\n\nI feel like this is just wrong. Just because we are writing a program does not mean we are writing code.\nCode implies programming, but programming does not imply code.\n\nAgreed, it's like saying a blueprint is \"code\".\n\nA blueprint is not a description of an algorithm.\n\nIt's not, but the actual implementation of the algorithm is.\n\nNot necessarily.

That's all there is to it.\n\nThe idea is that if you don't do this, then you have to write unit tests for _everything_, and that's just crazy. It's easier to just write the unit tests that test your core functions, and then let your users do the rest. If you don't have unit tests for the rest, then you haven't really finished your program, have you?\n\nYou don't have to write unit tests for everything. You just have to write them for the things that need them.

For example, maybe you want to compute a table of different types of values.\n\nI like your table example. The reason I dislike such function returning functions is that they're not true functions.

Let me tell you why.\nFirst, the code is not even remotely Pythonic. In fact, it is ugly and full of non-obvious details. I would not put it in my top 10 of bad code, but it is close.\nSecond, it shows the complete lack of knowledge about Python's _built-in_ function for multiplication. I could easily write a very succinct and elegant solution:\nx = 148 * 412\ny = 19 * 28\nz = 2020 * 1851\nreturn x * y * z\nOne could argue that this is a much uglier version of the OP's code, but it is much better in one important aspect: it uses built-in operators and built-in functions. This is a typical situation in which using the built-in tools will outperform any home-made solution, and the author of the answer failed to spot this.\nFinally, I would be very disappointed to find this kind of code in a top 10 list of \"ugliest code\". I have seen much worse code in my professional career, and the author of this answer is not in a position to judge, given that he has", "def multiply(a, b):\n    \"\"\"Complete the function that takes two integers and returns \n    the product of their unit digits.\n    Assume the input is always valid.\n    Examples:\n    multiply(148, 412) should return 16.\n    multiply(19, 28) should return 72.\n    multiply(2020, 1851) should return 0.\n    multiply(14,-15) should return 20.\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    a=b.split(\",\").map(x=>x[0])\n    return b.split(\",\").map(x=>x[0]+x[1])\n\nYou know, I just realised that the first part of the comment is unnecessary.\n\nThe Python version that I wrote:", "def multiply(a, b):\n    \"\"\"Complete the function that takes two integers and returns \n    the product of their unit digits.\n    Assume the input is always valid.\n    Examples:\n    multiply(148, 412) should return 16.\n    multiply(19, 28) should return 72.\n    multiply(2020, 1851) should return 0.\n    multiply(14,-15) should return 20.\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return a*b\n\nThe problem with this approach is that it is too general. This function will return zero for any input that is not a valid integer. This happens a lot in computer code. It is better to give the computer a limited set of legal inputs, and a limited set of illegal inputs.\nThe test suite for the software I work on contains over 600 tests, and more are added every day. I write the tests first, and then the code to implement the behavior specified by the tests.\n\nIn C this isn't such a big deal - there are only a handful of valid integer values. In Python, this is a bigger problem.

The only tricky thing is to deal with the possibility of the input being invalid, which is what the comment is for.\n\nActually, the use of the underscore in the comment is a bit misleading. What it means is that in the case that the input is invalid, the function should return NaN, or not a number.\nThis is an extremely common convention in Java and, in my opinion, one of the best things about the language. The convention is that methods that can take an invalid argument should either return an exception or throw an exception. Methods that can take an invalid argument and return a value are supposed to return a special value called `null` in Java.\nOf course, this is easily abused and I'm sure there are many people out there who don't follow this convention. But, if you want to be sure that your code is readable to someone who knows what they are doing, you should use this convention.\n\nOf course, if you don't want to clutter your code with tons of exceptions, you could always just have the function", "def multiply(a, b):\n    \"\"\"Complete the function that takes two integers and returns \n    the product of their unit digits.\n    Assume the input is always valid.\n    Examples:\n    multiply(148, 412) should return 16.\n    multiply(19, 28) should return 72.\n    multiply(2020, 1851) should return 0.\n    multiply(14,-15) should return 20.\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return int(a.digits[0] * b.digits[0]) + int(a.digits[1] * b.digits[1]) + int(a.digits[2] * b.digits[2]) + int(a.digits[3] * b.digits[3]) + int(a.digits[4] * b.digits[4]) + int(a.digits[5] * b.digits[5]) + int(a.digits[6] * b.digits[6]) + int(a.digits[7] * b.digits[7])\n\nYou've got to be kidding.

I'm still learning Python, but I'm already discovering that unit tests are incredibly useful.\nI think they're probably not the best way", "def multiply(a, b):\n    \"\"\"Complete the function that takes two integers and returns \n    the product of their unit digits.\n    Assume the input is always valid.\n    Examples:\n    multiply(148, 412) should return 16.\n    multiply(19, 28) should return 72.\n    multiply(2020, 1851) should return 0.\n    multiply(14,-15) should return 20.\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    var ud = 0\n    for i in xrange(2, a.length):\n         ud = ud * b.substring(i, a.length)\n    return ud\n\n>>> print(multiply(148, 412))\n16\n>>> print(multiply(19, 28))\n72\n>>> print(multiply(2020, 1851))\n0\n>>> print(multiply(14,-15))\n20\n\n>>> print(multiply(2, 3))\n6\n>>> print(multiply(2, 4))\n7\n\n>>> print(multiply(2,-3))\n1\n>>> print(multiply(2, 0))\n3\n\n>>> print(multiply(2, 1))\n3</s>", "def multiply(a, b):\n    \"\"\"Complete the function that takes two integers and returns \n    the product of their unit digits.\n    Assume the input is always valid.\n    Examples:\n    multiply(148, 412) should return 16.\n    multiply(19, 28) should return 72.\n    multiply(2020, 1851) should return 0.\n    multiply(14,-15) should return 20.\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return a*b", "def multiply(a, b):\n    \"\"\"Complete the function that takes two integers and returns \n    the product of their unit digits.\n    Assume the input is always valid.\n    Examples:\n    multiply(148, 412) should return 16.\n    multiply(19, 28) should return 72.\n    multiply(2020, 1851) should return 0.\n    multiply(14,-15) should return 20.\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    if a > 0:\n        return a*a\n    else:\n        return a*b\nThis is only true for unsigned integers, but it's a common error to assume a general case.</s>", "def multiply(a, b):\n    \"\"\"Complete the function that takes two integers and returns \n    the product of their unit digits.\n    Assume the input is always valid.\n    Examples:\n    multiply(148, 412) should return 16.\n    multiply(19, 28) should return 72.\n    multiply(2020, 1851) should return 0.\n    multiply(14,-15) should return 20.\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    if not b.is_integer:\n        return 0\n    return int(a.decode('hex')[2:])*int(b.decode('hex')[2:])</s>", "def multiply(a, b):\n    \"\"\"Complete the function that takes two integers and returns \n    the product of their unit digits.\n    Assume the input is always valid.\n    Examples:\n    multiply(148, 412) should return 16.\n    multiply(19, 28) should return 72.\n    multiply(2020, 1851) should return 0.\n    multiply(14,-15) should return 20.\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    a1 = a\n    a2 = b\n    return (a1*a1 + a2*a2)\n\nIn the last example, I can't get it to return 20, but it returns '20'\n\nI have no idea where I'm going wrong\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated\n\nThanks,\n\n- Joe\n\n20?\n\nIf you're having problems getting Python to return the correct answer, here's the code in Ruby:"]]
