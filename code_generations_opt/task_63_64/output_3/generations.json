Your function has to go through every element of the input every time it runs, because it doesn't know how many times it will need to loop.\n\nI'm not sure if it's obvious, but the first statement is an unconditional jump to the beginning of the function. It can't go to the loop body if the conditional is false.\n\nI think GP is making a comment on the fact that the return statement is never reached.\n\nI don't see why the return statement would never be reached.\n\nIf the condition is not met, the function immediately jumps to the beginning and never gets to the return.\n\nThank you for pointing this out.
