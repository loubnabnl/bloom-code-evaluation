If you put the brackets on a different line, like \"foo()\", then it's wrong.\n\nSo, you need a \"right\" and a \"wrong\" place for brackets.\nThat is, a function that takes a string of brackets and returns True if the brackets are in the right place, and False otherwise.\n\nYes, that's what I need.\n\nI don't see how this is possible. You can't know if the brackets are in the \"right\" place without knowing the language's rules.\n\nI guess that's why I'm asking.
