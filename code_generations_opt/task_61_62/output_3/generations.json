This is a very common pitfall that I fell into when I was first learning Python.\n\nMost of the time, when you want to check whether two things are equal, you're really interested in their _content_, rather than the _types_ they have. In other words, you want to test whether two things have the same values, not whether they have the same _attributes_ (in this case, the same str type).\nTo do that, you need to use __eq__, which is a method defined on types that implements a special __eq__ method for that type. The __eq__ method is _not_ defined on types that are not strings, bytestrings, or user-defined types.\n\nDefining correct_bracketing as a function that takes two strings (rather than one) and calls the correct_bracketing() method on each of them would work, because the correct_bracketing() method would return True iff both strings were correctly bracketed.\n\nAnother common pitfall is that many programmers, myself included,", "def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):\n    \"\"\" brackets is a string of \"(\" and \")\".\n    return True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.\n\n    >>> correct_bracketing(\"(\")\n    False\n    >>> correct_bracketing(\"()\")\n    True\n    >>> correct_bracketing(\"(()())\")\n    True\n    >>> correct_bracketing(\")(()\")\n    False\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n\nIt fails with the last one, which is the correct one.\n\nWorse, it can't handle a single closing bracket.\n\nOr multiple opening brackets.\n\nOr any character that's not a bracket.\n\nNot to mention the fact that there are other ways to get brackets right.

It would be interesting to see a more complete solution to this problem, especially since there are so many edge cases (for example, matching an expression that starts with a variable name, like `a + b + c`).\n\nWith the advent of languages like R, which require less thought to get right, this kind of thing is no longer an issue.</s>"]]
