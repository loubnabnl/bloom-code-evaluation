If I understand correctly, this is a function that returns a value that may or may not exist. That seems like a really bad idea. Why would you want to do that?\n\nThe function returns the longest string in a list of strings.

It's just that the dict class uses the same class name, and the built-in dict class is a subclass of the built-in list class.\n\nYes, but it's confusing.\n\nI think the confusion is a good thing.

I'm not sure if it's just a quirk of the example or if it's because they're going to be using list comprehensions.\n\nI think it's just a quirk of the example.
