To find the \"shortest\" path, I sort the list of cells in the row/column and then find the first element in the list which is less than the current cell.  That becomes the path.  In order to move on to the next row/column, I simply take the list for the previous row/column and remove the first element.  This is done recursively.\n\nThis is pretty slow, however.

What if I don't want to go off the grid? What if I want to know the absolute minimum length, and not just the minimum length that happens to go off the grid?\n\nAny suggestions?\n\nUPDATE:\n\nI think I found a solution that works.
