This example shows the use of a global variable in the if statement.  The variable sum_squares is used in the condition of the if statement, and thus is visible to all code that is executed by the if statement, including the body of the if statement itself.  This is not desirable because the variable sum_squares is a global variable, and thus all code that executes in the if block will be able to access the value of the variable sum_squares.  This is not necessarily a problem if the variable sum_squares is not used in any other code, but if the variable sum_squares is used in any other code, then the value of sum_squares will be changed by the code that uses it.
