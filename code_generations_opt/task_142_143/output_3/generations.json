The function will be called sum_squares(lst) but you only pass one argument to it, the list.  This is a common mistake for beginning programmers.  Also, there is no reason to use a lambda.  When a function is used as an argument to a lambda it is called a lambda expression.  Also, you don't need the parens.  It is perfectly valid to write:  return sum(map(lambda x: x**3, lst))\nThe errors are not serious, but they do affect the readability of your code.
