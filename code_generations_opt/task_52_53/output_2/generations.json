I'd bought a book on Python, and I started to read it. It wasn't long before I'd written a program that did something useful.\nI don't know if it's the case any more, but I remember that the documentation was very good.

The second solution has a number of flaws, but the biggest one is that it uses a list comprehension to do something that is very easy to do with a single for loop.\n\nThe second solution is just a way to write the first solution in a language that doesn't have list comprehensions.\n\nI don't think so. The second solution doesn't use a list comprehension, it uses a list comprehension with a for loop.\n\nYou are right, I missed the for loop.\n\nI have a question about the first solution.\nIf the list is empty, is the result True or False?\n\nI would expect it to be False.\n\nI've always been curious about this.\n\nI'm not sure that I understand the question, but I will try to answer it.\nThe return value of a function is the value that the function returns.

The code is still useful for its intended purpose (checking if a list is empty), but it would be better if it returned a tuple instead of a boolean.\n\nI would argue that the code is not useful for its intended purpose, because it's not clear what it means for a list to be \"below\" a threshold.\n\nI'm not sure what you mean.
