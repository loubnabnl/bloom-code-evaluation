I just use iter(l, True).\n\nI'm pretty sure it's not.\n\nIf you like, you can use the built-in _any() function instead of the built-in len() function. It will work with any iterable.\n\nThanks, it's interesting that it's not documented as working on all iterables.\n\nThe only thing I don't like about the Python language is the lack of a namespace. I'd like to see some sort of implementation of namespaces that allows you to define modules and then import modules from other namespaces.\n\nYou can do this with\nfrom module import *\nor\nimport module\nand the module can be from any namespace, including the global namespace.\nWhat would you need the global namespace for?\n\nI like to be able to organize code into different namespaces for different projects.

A list with one element is always empty.\n\nJust because you have one element doesn't mean the list is empty. You have to define empty for your specific data structure.\n\nSorry, but I don't buy that. I'm not saying you have to have a list that contains an empty list in order to have an empty list.

The difference between \"def below_threshold(l: list, t: int):\" and \"def below_threshold(l: list, t: int):\" is that the former is a list comprehension, and the latter is not.\n\nList comprehension is a syntactic construct, not an expression.

In general it is not a good idea to use len to determine whether a list is empty, and it is not a good idea to use len to determine whether an int is smaller than another int (if the ints are the same size, the second is clearly smaller than the first).\nWhat if you wanted to check whether all the numbers in the list are greater than some number? Would you use the same method?\n\nI used len() because it is simple and \"obvious\" to understand. Of course len() should not be used to compare two different numbers, but in my case I just needed to know if a list is not empty, then the test with len() is fine.\nIf I had wanted to check whether a list is not empty, but also whether a list is not empty and that a list is not empty, I would have used an if-else.

If your query only returns the first few elements of the list, you are still returning True. The other option is to use a dictionary, but then you have to make sure the user doesn't see the keys, which is not easy.\n\nThe best way I have found to do this is to have a list of key:value pairs, where the key is the number, and the value is a boolean (or in some cases, a function) that returns true or false based on the number. Then you use a regular list comprehension to check if the values are true or false.\nHere's an example:\n>>> [1, 2, 3]\n[True, True, False]\n>>> 1 < 3\nTrue\n>>> 1 == 2\nTrue\n>>> 1 < 3 && 1 == 2\nTrue\n>>> 2 < 3\nTrue\n>>>", "def below_threshold(l: list, t: int):\n    \"\"\"Return True if all numbers in the list l are below threshold t.\n    >>> below_threshold([1, 2, 4, 10], 100)\n    True\n    >>> below_threshold([1, 20, 4, 10], 5)\n    False\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    raise ValueError('The input list contains at least one number above threshold'+ t + '.')\n\n    if l is None:\n         raise ValueError('The input list must be given.

It's better to raise TypeError instead of ValueError, so it can be caught and handled.\n\nThen it would be a TypeError to call the function with an empty list. I don't see how this is a benefit?\n\nIf you're expecting an empty list, you can check for that. If you aren't expecting an empty list, it's a bug.\n\nI think he meant that the above method would raise TypeError if l is empty.

There's no curly brackets, no semicolons and no parentheses. So it's very easy to read.
