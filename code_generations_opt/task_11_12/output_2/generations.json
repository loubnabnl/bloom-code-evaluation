What happens if you want to extract the 1s and 0s from a string? You could do it with a regex, but it's more error prone.\n\nYou can use the string.split() method to extract the 1s and 0s.\n\nI think that's what the parent was saying. That's what I'd do too.\n\nMy point is that there is no way to do what the OP is trying to do without using a list comprehension.\n\nI think the parent was saying that the OP's example was a bad example, not that the OP's task was impossible.\n\nI think it's a good example.\n\nI'm pretty sure this is a joke.\n\nI think the joke is that it's not a joke.\n\nI think the joke is that it", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\" Input are two strings a and b consisting only of 1s and 0s.\n    Perform binary XOR on these inputs and return result also as a string.\n    >>> string_xor('010', '110')\n    '100'\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return string.ascii_lowercase(b[0] ^ a[0])\n\nfrom typing import List", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\" Input are two strings a and b consisting only of 1s and 0s.\n    Perform binary XOR on these inputs and return result also as a string.\n    >>> string_xor('010', '110')\n    '100'\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    a = a.decode('utf-8')\n    b = b.decode('utf-8')\n    return a ^ b\n\nList(string_xor('010', '110'))\n\nThe above is a perfectly valid python code. I just want to know why?\n\nIt's not a good example of anything other than a list comprehension. The purpose of list comprehensions is to make it easy to do things like:\n>>> lst = [x for x in range(10)]\n>>> lst\n[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\nThis is a much more readable way of expressing the same thing:\n>>> lst = range(10)\n>>> lst\n[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\nThe above is also easier to write in some languages (like C).\n\nI guess I'm not sure what you're getting at.

that would make it easier to read is if it were an argument to the function instead of an attribute.\n\nI think that would make it harder to read.\n\nIt's definitely a tradeoff, but I think it would be easier to read if you could simply refer to a method as \"foo\" rather than \"foo(args, kwargs, self, foo, bar)\".\n\nI think that's a good point.
