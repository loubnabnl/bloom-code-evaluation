I've used this before, but I think it's a little too clever for its own good.\n\nThis one is actually useful. I use it all the time to find the first non-zero element in a list.\n\nI've always used the following, which is equally as terse:", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:\n    \"\"\" Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than\n    given threshold.\n    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)\n    False\n    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)\n    True\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return numbers.any(numbers.get(0), numbers.get(1)).difference(0.5)\n    < 0.3\n\nI think the `get` method should be called `get_or_create` or something.\n\nI think that's just a matter of convention.\n\nIs this supposed to be a joke?\n\nI think it's a joke about how people tend to create a lot of classes in Python.\n\nThat's not a joke. It's just a fact.</s>", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:\n    \"\"\" Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than\n    given threshold.\n    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)\n    False\n    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)\n    True\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n\n    for i in numbers:\n        if i - threshold < 1.0:\n           return True\n       return False\n\nfrom typing import List", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:\n    \"\"\" Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than\n    given threshold.\n    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)\n    False\n    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)\n    True\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    if numbers:\n        return numbers.any(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(n", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:\n    \"\"\" Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than\n    given threshold.\n    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)\n    False\n    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)\n    True\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return numbers.count() > threshold", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:\n    \"\"\" Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than\n    given threshold.\n    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)\n    False\n    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)\n    True\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    if n1 < n2:\n       return True\n    return False", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:\n    \"\"\" Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than\n    given threshold.\n    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)\n    False\n    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)\n    True\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return numbers.count() > threshold\n\nI think you mean:\nreturn numbers.count() > threshold\n\nCorrect, thank you.\n\nI don't think it's a good idea to use global variables in Python.\n\nThanks.\n\nIs there a reason why the author didn't use a list comprehension?\n\nYes, I've read somewhere that list comprehension is slower than nested list comprehensions.\n\nThat's not really true. I don't know where you read that, but it's not true. The only thing that's slower than a list comprehension is a for loop.\n\nI guess it's true if you have a huge list and you're not using any of the values in it.\n\nIt's not.\n\nWhat's the difference between \"import typing\" and \"from typing import List\"?\n\n\"import typing\" is a decorator that provides a function called \"__enter__\" that is called when the module is imported. This is used to provide a \"__main__\" function.\n\"from typing import List\" is the same as \"from typing import *\", except that it imports the module \"List\" instead of \"List\" and all of its submodules", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:\n    \"\"\" Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than\n    given threshold.\n    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)\n    False\n    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)\n    True\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return len(numbers) == 2\nI would suggest using Python's builtin function `all()` for this.\n\nTrue, but this is a good exercise in recursion.\n\nI think the problem with this is that Python's built-in functions are already so good, that there's no need to create your own.\n\nI'd say this is a good exercise in creating a class.\n\nI like the concept of the post, but the implementation seems a little sloppy.\n\nI agree, it's sloppy. But then again, it's a post about recursion, not about the best way to do things in Python.\n\nThat's true, but if you're going to post a solution to a problem, I think it's a good idea to make it as clean as possible.\n\nWhat's the point of this?\n\nIt's an exercise in recursion.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause it's a good way to learn how to use recursion.\n\nWhat's the point of learning how to use recursion?\n\nRecursion is a useful tool in programming.\n\nWhy?\n\nI don't know why you're asking me this. It's", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:\n    \"\"\" Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than\n    given threshold.\n    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)\n    False\n    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)\n    True\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return len(numbers) == 0\n\nI don't understand why this is on the front page of HN.\n\nIt's a joke.\n\nI get the joke, I just don't get why it's on the front page.\n\nThe joke is that Python programmers are lazy.\n\nI'm not sure that's the joke. I think the joke is that the language itself is somewhat lazy.\n\nThe joke is that the language allows you to write code like this.\n\nBut it's not _that_ bad.\n\nI'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not, but I think the joke is that it's pretty bad.\n\nI'm being sincere. I think it's a perfectly reasonable way to write that code.\n\nI think that it's a perfectly reasonable way to write code. I'm not sure if it's a perfectly reasonable way to write code _in Python_.\n\nI don't see why not.
