The basic rule of thumb is that xrange is faster when it has to be smart (e.g. when it needs to do a modulo, or an if), and range is faster when it can be dumb (e.g. when the first argument is a number).\n\nI find it", "def count_up_to(n):\n    \"\"\"Implement a function that takes an non-negative integer and returns an array of the first n\n    integers that are prime numbers and less than n.\n    for example:\n    count_up_to(5) => [2,3]\n    count_up_to(11) => [2,3,5,7]\n    count_up_to(0) => []\n    count_up_to(20) => [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19]\n    count_up_to(1) => []\n    count_up_to(18) => [2,3,5,7,11,13,17]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    a = array(n)\n    for i in range(0,n):\n       if a[i] == 1:\n           a[i] = i\n           continue\n    return a\nThe first problem I see here is that you're using a single array to represent a list of prime numbers.

Keep track of all the primes you've already seen?  That seems much more inefficient.\nJust use the integer builtin.  It's not like you have a lot of primes to check, you can just check them in the order they are entered.  You don't need to keep track of what you've seen because you're not going to see any duplicate primes.\n>it's not like you have a lot of primes to check  I think you underestimate the effort of checking every prime between 1 and 20.\nYou're right, but this is python where every time you add the number 1 to a list, you have to check if that list is empty.
