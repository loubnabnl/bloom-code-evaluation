The first line of the function is the definition of the function. Then the function is called with a parameter of 3. The function then loops through the range of numbers from 1 to 3 and checks if each number is even or odd. If the number is even then the function returns the number. If the number is odd then the function returns a tuple with the number of even and odd integer palindromes.\n\nPython: Even_Odd_Palindrome", "def even_odd_palindrome(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a positive integer n, return a tuple that has the number of even and odd\n    integer palindromes that fall within the range(1, n), inclusive.\n\n    Example 1:\n\n        Input: 3\n        Output: (1, 2)\n        Explanation:\n        Integer palindrome are 1, 2, 3. one of them is even, and two of them are odd.\n\n    Example 2:\n\n        Input: 12\n        Output: (4, 6)\n        Explanation:\n        Integer palindrome are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11. four of them are even, and 6 of them are odd.\n\n    Note:\n        1. 1 <= n <= 10^3\n        2. returned tuple has the number of even and odd integer palindromes respectively.\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    #

What's the benefit of returning a tuple instead of a list?\n\nThe tuple is to make the function more readable and easier to understand.\n\nIt's not easier to understand. The tuple is not needed. You could just as well return a list.\n\nIt's easier to understand. I don't know what a list is.\n\nAre you being serious? A list is a list of items.
