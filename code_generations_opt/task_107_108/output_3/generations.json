It's even in the language description.\n\nWhen I see posts like this, I am always amazed at how much code I could have written if I had thought of it.\n\nBecause you didn't think of it, this code will seem to be really smart. In reality, it is very simple. It's just that you (and me) are not familiar with Python.\n\nActually, I've been working in Python for a while. I'm just amazed at how many times I don't consider the obvious solutions, even though they're obvious to other people.\n\nNot just Python. I've been doing Java for 4 years now and I'm still amazed at how easy it is for people to write some really cool stuff without having to resort to the 'enterprisey' stuff.\n\nRelated: \n\nIt could be

Why would you want the number of even and odd integer palindromes?

(This is part of a homework question from a class)\n\nIn this case, it may make more sense to count the number of palindromes in the range instead of the number of even and odd palindromes. (Since you can have palindromes in which both even and odd numbers are repeated.)\n\nHowever, I can't think of a way to count the number of palindromes using only Python. (You could use the set() built-in function to count the number of palindromes, but that would require a loop to calculate the number of palindromes up to a given number.)</s>", "def even_odd_palindrome(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a positive integer n, return a tuple that has the number of even and odd\n    integer palindromes that fall within the range(1, n), inclusive.\n\n    Example 1:\n\n        Input: 3\n        Output: (1, 2)\n        Explanation:\n        Integer palindrome are 1, 2, 3. one of them is even, and two of them are odd.\n\n    Example 2:\n\n        Input: 12\n        Output: (4, 6)\n        Explanation:\n        Integer palindrome are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11. four of them are even, and 6 of them are odd.\n\n    Note:\n        1. 1 <= n <= 10^3\n        2. returned tuple has the number of even and odd integer palindromes respectively.\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    for i in range(1,n):\n         return tuple([i for i in even_odd_palindrome(n - i - 1) if i % 2 == 0])", "def even_odd_palindrome(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a positive integer n, return a tuple that has the number of even and odd\n    integer palindromes that fall within the range(1, n), inclusive.\n\n    Example 1:\n\n        Input: 3\n        Output: (1, 2)\n        Explanation:\n        Integer palindrome are 1, 2, 3. one of them is even, and two of them are odd.\n\n    Example 2:\n\n        Input: 12\n        Output: (4, 6)\n        Explanation:\n        Integer palindrome are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11. four of them are even, and 6 of them are odd.\n\n    Note:\n        1. 1 <= n <= 10^3\n        2. returned tuple has the number of even and odd integer palindromes respectively.\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"", "def even_odd_palindrome(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a positive integer n, return a tuple that has the number of even and odd\n    integer palindromes that fall within the range(1, n), inclusive.\n\n    Example 1:\n\n        Input: 3\n        Output: (1, 2)\n        Explanation:\n        Integer palindrome are 1, 2, 3. one of them is even, and two of them are odd.\n\n    Example 2:\n\n        Input: 12\n        Output: (4, 6)\n        Explanation:\n        Integer palindrome are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11. four of them are even, and 6 of them are odd.\n\n    Note:\n        1. 1 <= n <= 10^3\n        2. returned tuple has the number of even and odd integer palindromes respectively.\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    # \"n\" must be a positive integer\n    return (even_odd_palindrome(n - 1) for n in range(1, n))\n\nSince you can trivially solve the original problem with a recursive function, you don't need recursion for this problem, so there's no point in using Python's recursion.\n\nI have a feeling that you are being down voted for the same reason I am.
