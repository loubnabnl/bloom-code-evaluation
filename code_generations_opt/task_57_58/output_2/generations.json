If you want to test if two lists are monotonically increasing, you can just compare them:\n>>> is_monotonically_increasing(1,2,4,20)\nTrue\n>>> is_monotonically_increasing([1, 2, 4, 20])\nFalse\n\nI think it's a good idea.\nThe thing is, you can't just compare lists, because you might have multiple lists that are monotonically increasing. This is a case where the list comprehension syntax is useful.\n\nI know you can't compare lists, but you can compare the elements of a list.\n\nI'm not sure what you're trying to say.
