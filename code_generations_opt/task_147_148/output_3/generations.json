But once you're past that stage and want to do your own tricks, it can be a bit confusing when you don't understand how the standard library works.\n\nI'm currently working on a little game engine for Python and I wanted to get the memory footprint of the string constants down. It turned out to be a lot more complicated than I expected because Python strings are allocated on the heap and then copied into a little memory pool. This pool is only freed when it is not being used.\n\nThe other option is to use char arrays which are allocated on the stack and can be freed immediately. But I can't use char arrays with the standard string classes, which I need to for my game engine.\n\nSo I decided to write my own little string class that supports both heap-based and stack-based allocation.\n\nI'll give you a short explanation of what happens behind the scenes, and then you can see the code at the bottom of the post.\n\nIf you allocate a string on the heap,", "def get_max_triples(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    You are given a positive integer n.
