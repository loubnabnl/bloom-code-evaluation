It's not even a matter of being a better or worse language. It's just that Python's syntax is so much less readable.\n\nYou can't just say something is less readable and then not give any reasons.\n\nI've written a response to this before, but it's probably worth repeating:\nThe problem with Python is that it's syntactically flexible to the point where the syntax can get in the way of the meaning.\nFor instance, the above code could be written as:", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:\n    \"\"\" For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation\n    around the mean of this dataset.\n    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each\n    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):\n    MAD = average | x - x_mean |\n    >>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])\n    1.0\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return (sum(abs(x - mean) for x in numbers)) / len(numbers)\n\nThis is a great example of why you shouldn't import random modules.\n\nI'm curious, why is that?\n\nIt's a good example of a module that does one thing well, but doesn't have a very good API.\n\nI don't know much about python, but I'm pretty sure that's the opposite of what a module should be.\n\nI'm not sure what you mean.\n\nI think I misunderstood the purpose of the module. It's not for general use, it's for a specific task.\n\nThe point is that it's a module that is easy to use, but not easy to use well.\n\nOh, okay. I got that, but I didn't see it as a problem.\n\nI think it's a fine example of what a module should be. It's one of those modules that you use, and then you keep using it because you don't know any better.\n\nI suppose I would have liked to see some examples of the \"easy to use, not easy to use well\" module.\n\nThis is a good example of", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:\n    \"\"\" For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation\n    around the mean of this dataset.\n    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each\n    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):\n    MAD = average | x - x_mean |\n    >>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])\n    1.0\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    mean = 1.0\n    for i in range(len(numbers)):\n        mean += numbers[i] * float(numbers[i])\n    return mean / len(numbers)\n\nI was hoping this would be a list comprehension.\n\nMe too.\n\nIt's an interesting problem, and I'm sure there are a number of ways to do it, but here's a basic one that I came up with.\nfrom typing import List", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:\n    \"\"\" For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation\n    around the mean of this dataset.\n    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each\n    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):\n    MAD = average | x - x_mean |\n    >>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])\n    1.0\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    mean_absolute_deviation = 0.0\n    for i in numbers:\n        mean_absolute_deviation += abs(i - mean_absolute_deviation)\n\nThe author of the article is not a native English speaker.\n\nI understand that the author is not a native English speaker.

That's the point of the exercise.\nFor example, if you're teaching them Java, you'd have them start with a small problem and then show them how to use a class to solve it. You'd be teaching them how to use the language.\nIf you're teaching them Python, you'd have them start with a small problem and then show them how to use a function to solve it.

One of the most interesting chapters was about the evolution of the language Python.\nThe author mentioned that in the early days, Python used to be a language of academic computer science. It was used to write programs that were so complicated that there was no chance of them being used in the real world.\nIn this spirit, the author described a function that calculated the average absolute deviation of a list of numbers. This function was included in the Python standard library.\n\nI find this an interesting example because it shows how you can take a simple mathematical concept and implement it in a very simple way.\nIn the context of the article, I think the author is trying to show that Python is more than just a simple language for beginners.\n\nI don't think that's the author's point. The article is about the importance of understanding the _why_ of a piece of code.\nThe mean", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:\n    \"\"\" For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation\n    around the mean of this dataset.\n    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each\n    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):\n    MAD = average | x - x_mean |\n    >>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])\n    1.0\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    mean = 0.0\n    for i in numbers:\n       mean += float(numbers[i]) - mean\n    return mean / len(numbers)\n\nI think you mean:", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:\n    \"\"\" For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation\n    around the mean of this dataset.\n    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each\n    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):\n    MAD = average | x - x_mean |\n    >>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])\n    1.0\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    mean = 0.0\n\n    for x in numbers:\n        mean += x * x_mean\n        mean /= len(numbers)\n    return mean / len(numbers)\n\nThis is a great example of what I call \"toy code\". It's useful for demonstrating a concept, but you wouldn't actually use it in production code.\n\nThis code is useful if you want to find the mean absolute deviation for a given set of numbers.\n\nI think what he means is that the code is too short to be useful. I'm not sure I agree, but it is hard to see how this code could be improved without making it longer.\n\nThe code could be improved by using a loop instead of an OO function.\n\nI like this one better:", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:\n    \"\"\" For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation\n    around the mean of this dataset.\n    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each\n    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):\n    MAD = average | x - x_mean |\n    >>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])\n    1.0\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return 1.0 / (sum(abs(numbers)) / len(numbers))\n\nI've used this in a few places.

You would instead use a list of floats and calculate the mean yourself, or use an array of floats and calculate the mean of each one.\n\nI don't think that's true. The return value of a function is up to the programmer.\n\nIn Python, a function can return any type. It's not unusual to see functions that return lists, tuples, or dicts.\n\nI just took a class in Python and it was interesting to see this. A lot of the examples in the book were written in a way that would be considered very poor form in Java or C++, but in Python they're perfectly acceptable.\n\nI don't know about C++, but I've written a lot of Java code and I've never seen a function that returns a list of things.\n\nI think he means the function that takes a list of things and", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:\n    \"\"\" For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation\n    around the mean of this dataset.\n    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each\n    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):\n    MAD = average | x - x_mean |\n    >>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])\n    1.0\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return (float(x) - float(x_mean)) / float(len(numbers))\n\nI think that's an example of the sort of code that's hard to understand.\nI'm not saying it's bad code, but it's hard to understand.\n\nI don't know.

You can't put a space before the colon in the ternary operator.\nIt's not a huge deal, but it's one of those little things that makes me want to punch the screen sometimes.\n\nAh, I see what you mean.
