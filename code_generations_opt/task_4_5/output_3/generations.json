You might have seen it before if you were working in Python for a while. There are other modules available, for example, datetime. It is available by default for Python 3. I think it is not enabled by default in Python 2.7, but it is pretty easy to enable it. You can simply type the following command in a terminal:\n\nsudo easy_install datetime\n\nI think this is a pretty cool feature of Python. You can use any module, either the ones shipped with the Python package or the ones that are available as a third-party package. I think that this is really useful for people who need to build a library that is generic and not tied to a specific task.\n\nIf you were working with a big library that uses this kind of feature, I think you will find the following problem:\n\nHow can you make sure that every code you write is using the exact same module?\n\nIf you want to use a third-party library, there is an", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:\n    \"\"\" For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation\n    around the mean of this dataset.\n    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each\n    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):\n    MAD = average | x - x_mean |\n    >>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])\n    1.0\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    for number in numbers:\n          mean_absolute_deviation(number)\n    return sum(mean_absolute_deviation(numbers)) / len(numbers)\n\nThis is the correct answer.\n\nI wish it was accepted to use mean absolute deviation on lists, but it is not, so for this week's hackernews quiz, this solution is wrong.\n\nGuido's solution is correct, but for different reasons. I don't think anyone would expect that a[0] and a[n] would be equal in the first place.\n\nI don't think Guido's solution is correct because mean_absolute_deviation doesn't take a list, it takes a single element. The whole point of Guido's solution is that a[0] and a[n] are equal to a[0] for _n_ in the range of [0, n].\n\nGuido's solution is correct. Let's work through it.\nFirst, a bit of algebra:\nIf we take the inner product of two vectors, the result is a vector whose length is the sum of their lengths, multiplied by the cosine", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:\n    \"\"\" For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation\n    around the mean of this dataset.\n    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each\n    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):\n    MAD = average | x - x_mean |\n    >>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])\n    1.0\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    mean_absolute_deviation = float(np.mean(numbers) / float(len(numbers)))\n    print(\"Mean Absolute Deviation = %.4f\" % mean_absolute_deviation)\n\nI thought the joke was that python provides a built-in function named \"from typing import List\".\n\nI thought the joke was that the Python interpreter is a context manager that can re-use the built-in functions defined in a module.\n\nThat's not a joke, it's just how Python works.\n\nI'm surprised to see Python on the list. I've always found the Python debugger to be pretty nice. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nI have found pdb to be one of the least usable debuggers of any language I've used.\n\nIt depends on your viewpoint. The debugger is definitely for the \"scripting\" end of the spectrum. It's also one of the major reasons why people who don't know any better think Python is just a \"scripting\" language.\nBut it works well for the intended use case.

It's just a little decorator that creates a dictionary of tuples.\n\nI'm the author. Thanks for the comment! I was trying to be clever by making a dictionary. Of course, one could just create a dictionary from scratch.\n\nNo problem!

I didn't get that :)\n\nThe thing that I like about Python is the attitude that the language is a tool.\nI always feel that the amount of time I spend learning a new language is proportional to the amount of time I have to spend using that language.\nI like Python, but I don't like the way the community tends to evangelise the language. It's as if they believe that if you're not using Python, you're missing out on something.\nThe point is that there are lots of great languages out there, and there is no best language.\n\nI agree. It's the same with Ruby.\n\nI love Python, but the way \"from typing import List\" is always mentioned, I expect it to be some magical feature that other languages are missing.\nEvery language has lists, and Python doesn", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:\n    \"\"\" For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation\n    around the mean of this dataset.\n    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each\n    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):\n    MAD = average | x - x_mean |\n    >>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])\n    1.0\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return max(abs(numbers[-1].mean() - numbers[-1].mean()) for n in numbers)\n\nThis is still in Python 2.4.2's builtin `typing` module.\n\nIn python 3.0+, where 'numbers' is a builtin module, you get:\nfrom typing import List", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:\n    \"\"\" For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation\n    around the mean of this dataset.\n    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each\n    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):\n    MAD = average | x - x_mean |\n    >>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])\n    1.0\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return 0.5 * sqrt(sum(abs(x - mean) * nums) / (nums + 1))\n\nWhy not mean absolute deviation?\n\nBecause mean absolute deviation is not the same as \"mean absolute deviation around the mean\".\n\nWow, I'm sorry, I'm stupid, I was thinking mean absolute deviation around the mean was just mean absolute deviation.\n\nOk, I am sorry for being so harsh. I was a little bit in a hurry when I wrote the comment.\n\nI love Python, but I don't love the way this is done.\nIf you're going to use a list comprehension, you should always specify the type you're working with. It's a bit of an abomination to type \"from typing import List\", but then fail to specify a type when using it.\nIt would be better to do this:\nfrom typing import List", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:\n    \"\"\" For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation\n    around the mean of this dataset.\n    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each\n    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):\n    MAD = average | x - x_mean |\n    >>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])\n    1.0\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return sum(abs(x - mean)) / len(numbers)\n\nYou can also do this with a list comprehension:\n>>> from typing import List\n>>> [x.mean(x) for x in numbers]\n[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]\n>>> mean_absolute_deviation(numbers)\n1.0\n\nAs the author of the article, I'm not entirely sure why you'd do this, but I'm glad you did.\n\nIt's useful when you want to compute the average absolute deviation for a list of things.\n\nWell, I didn't want to say the obvious, but this is actually a fun toy problem.

The only difference is that lists are mutable and sets aren't.\nThe fact that the set library is built on top of a mutable type and has mutable operations only makes it more confusing.\n\nOne significant difference is that the set library does not support append.\n\nI'd say that is the least significant difference, since there's no reason to append a set.\n\nI have used python for years, and I cannot think of a single situation where I would need to use a list type that was mut", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:\n    \"\"\" For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation\n    around the mean of this dataset.\n    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each\n    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):\n    MAD = average | x - x_mean |\n    >>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])\n    1.0\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    mean = sum(numbers)\n\n    min = 0.0\n\n    max = sum(numbers)\n\n    for i, element in enumerate(numbers):\n        if element!= mean:\n           mean += element\n           min += element\n           max += element\n           mean_absolute_deviation(numbers)\n    return mean\n\nA minor quibble: the Python documentation describes sum() as returning a list.

I just meant that I see many people in this thread use \"def\" rather than \"def func\" when writing methods. Why do people do that?\n\nYou can either use the \"def\" statement to define a function, or define a function with \"def func\". I don't think there is a reason to use the former instead of the latter.\n\nIn the early days of Python, many people would define a function within a class, and so would use the \"def\" statement to define a function.\nI believe that this", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:\n    \"\"\" For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation\n    around the mean of this dataset.\n    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each\n    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):\n    MAD = average | x - x_mean |\n    >>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])\n    1.0\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    mean_absolute_deviation = float(sum(float(number) - float(x_mean)))\n\nI actually learned something from that.

The difference between \"average\" and \"mean\" is that one is the arithmetic mean and the other is the geometric mean. If you're going to calculate the mean absolute deviation around the mean then the geometric mean is the right thing to use.\nThe interesting thing about the code is that it's not very idiomatic Python. Instead of typing from typing import List you could have written 'numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:\n    \"\"\" For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation\n    around the mean of this dataset.\n    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each\n    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):\n    MAD = average | x - x_mean |\n    >>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])\n    1.0\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n\n    k = 0\n\n    for i in numbers:\n         k += abs(i)\n\n    return k * (1.0 - MAD)\n\nThe problem with this is that it's vulnerable to outliers.\n\nIndeed. The authors attempt to address this by looking at the standard deviation of the data and using that to weight the deviation. But I'd argue that even that is probably insufficient, and you could still end up with an average that doesn't really fit the data.\n\nThe standard deviation of the data is probably the best statistical measure available for a set of numbers.\nA great example of why not to use the mean, is a set of numbers that are all multiples of 2 (e.g. 5, 10, 15, 20...) and another set with one outlier (e.g. 16). The mean of these two sets would be the same but the standard deviation would be significantly different.\n\nI agree. It's just that it's probably not sufficient to determine the \"center point\" of the set, because there's no such thing as \"the center point\" for a set of numbers that are not randomly chosen.", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:\n    \"\"\" For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation\n    around the mean of this dataset.\n    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each\n    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):\n    MAD = average | x - x_mean |\n    >>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])\n    1.0\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n\n    numbers_list = List.from_iterable(numbers)\n    numbers_list.sort()\n       for i in range(len(numbers_list)):\n          mean_absolute_deviation(numbers_list[i], mean)\n\nI've been working on something similar. I've always been curious how difficult this sort of thing would be to implement in a Python interpreter.\n\nI've done something similar for a real-time messaging system. I basically used the double.mean() function to determine the mean, then the absolute value function to determine the absolute difference, then I used the median of the absolute differences as the new mean. I did this every 0.1 seconds to update the mean.\nThis worked really well, and I was able to make the calculations in about 10 microseconds per iteration.\n\n(defun mean_absolute_deviation (numbers)\n(let ((len (length numbers)))\n(sort (lambda (l)\n(cond ((= (car l) 'a) (car l)\n((= (car l) 'b) (cdr l)", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:\n    \"\"\" For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation\n    around the mean of this dataset.\n    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each\n    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):\n    MAD = average | x - x_mean |\n    >>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])\n    1.0\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    (x - x_mean) / (numbers.size() - 1)\n\nThis isn't an accurate description of MAD.

I just assumed they were asking \"if I don't import this, what will it do?\"\n\nI think that's the reason they bring it up.\n\nSo the person who wrote that line of code was probably a Python user!\n\nIt's pretty clear that it is the case. They have no need for the module they import, but they import it anyway.\n\nMy advice is to be a Python user, but avoid using the 'import' idiom like the plague.\n\nThe import idiom is great when you're writing small programs.

The formula I quoted is the formula for variance.\nI can only assume that the author had an intent of using the formula for\n\"average absolute difference\" rather than for \"variance\".\nThe formula for average absolute difference is:\nMAD = (sum(x_diff - x_mean) for x_diff in numbers) / len(numbers)\nwhere x_mean = mean(numbers)\n\nInteresting, I would have thought this was a common use case.

The only way to do this is to use namedtuples, which are much harder to read than the function itself. And you're right, this is not obvious (and sometimes not possible) to infer from context.\nPython has a long way to go in the area of static typing, but this is by design, and there are other languages for people who need this.\n\nI guess we just", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:\n    \"\"\" For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation\n    around the mean of this dataset.\n    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each\n    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):\n    MAD = average | x - x_mean |\n    >>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])\n    1.0\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    for i in numbers:\n        mean_absolute_deviation(numbers[i])\n\nIf you think that's bad, you should see the APIs that are given to third-party developers.

One thing I'd like to point out though is that your code here doesn't really address the issue of how to determine the mean, which is what the problem is asking for. In other words, the problem is asking you to determine the mean of a list of floating point numbers.\n\nI don't see the point of the comment. The problem doesn't ask to use any functions that haven't been provided, just that the answer must be a list.\n\nThe point of the comment is that calculating the mean of a list of floating point numbers is difficult and probably not worth solving when a simple solution is available.\n\nI don't think calculating the mean of a list of floating point numbers is any more difficult than calculating the mean of a list of integers. Sure, it's a bit more involved, but not difficult.\n\nThat's not the point.

I think it would be better to teach the concept of variance instead.\n\nVariance is a bit more abstract than mean absolute deviation.

Lists are often more useful than arrays when you're dealing with a lot of data.\nFor example, the article criticizes the following code for not handling indexing into the list:\nlist(arr.pop())\nBecause the indexing is not supported, a different approach is required.\nHowever, if you've got a lot of data, and you don't have a good way of knowing where your index is, is it really a good idea to index into it?\n\nI think his criticism is actually that the code is still readable but less efficient.\n\nIn this case, it seems like a win-win situation.

You can look stuff up!\n\nI think dictionary is good to know but you need to remember to use it.\n\nThis is the sort of thing that I don't understand why people find so interesting. It's certainly well written, but the fact that you can write a python function that returns the mean of a list of numbers and another that returns the mean absolute deviation of a list of numbers has never in my life seemed like a big deal.\n\nI disagree. I think there is a lot of value in learning some basic programming. Programming, in its rawest form, is the most direct and efficient way to express ideas.\n\nAgreed, but the idea of writing a \"mean()\" function seems like a pretty easy, and very common, one. In fact, the more I think about it, the more I feel like \"mean_absolute_deviation\" is overkill. It's a"]]
