It's to make the code easier to read, because the reader is able to see the relation between each element in the list with respect to the index. And if you do the same with nested dictionaries it will be a little easier to read, because the reader will know where the keys and values are coming from.\n\nNo, there isn't.

Because it's perfectly readable for someone who has seen the code before. I would say it's not readable for someone who is learning the code for the first time, and it's not readable for people who are already familiar with the code, who are reading it in another language or looking at it from a different angle.\n\nWhen you encounter code you haven't seen before, you have two options: you can stop, go away and try to find someone who has seen it before, or you can read it and try to figure out what it does.", "def get_row(lst, x):\n    \"\"\"\n    You are given a 2 dimensional data, as a nested lists,\n    which is similar to matrix, however, unlike matrices,\n    each row may contain a different number of columns.\n    Given lst, and integer x, find integers x in the list,\n    and return list of tuples, [(x1, y1), (x2, y2) ...] such that\n    each tuple is a coordinate -

In Python 3, there is also a itertools module which is a list of functions similar to the list methods, and it has a get_row method.\nhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html\n\nI don't know why you are being downvoted. I'm going to guess that the reason is that Python 3 is new, and not widely used.

I'd always used range() as an iterator, and never thought of it as a for loop. I suspect there's more like this in my Python code...\n\nPretty sure range() isn't a for loop. What's happening is that range() calls get_row() recursively and passes it a new argument.\n\nThere is no get_row() recursion. The recursion is all in the range() function.\n\nThat's what I meant.\n\nWhy is this on the front page? This is an excerpt from the documentation on range(). I'm not even sure what you're asking?

What is the Python version of this?\n\nThe \"Python\" version is just a very contrived example. The C version is just doing an in-place sort of the entire vector and then iterating over the resulting sorted list (in reverse). It's likely that the sort itself is unnecessary for this, but they didn't bother with a fast one.\n\nI think it is a bad example.
