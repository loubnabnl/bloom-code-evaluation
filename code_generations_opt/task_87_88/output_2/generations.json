Is it just to make it easier to write code that works on lists?\n\nYes. It makes it easier to write code that works on a 2D list (like a matrix), but is easier to understand and use than NumPy.\n\nIt would be nice if this worked with numpy.</s>", "def get_row(lst, x):\n    \"\"\"\n    You are given a 2 dimensional data, as a nested lists,\n    which is similar to matrix, however, unlike matrices,\n    each row may contain a different number of columns.\n    Given lst, and integer x, find integers x in the list,\n    and return list of tuples, [(x1, y1), (x2, y2) ...] such that\n    each tuple is a coordinate - (row, columns), starting with 0.\n    Sort coordinates initially by rows in ascending order.\n    Also, sort coordinates of the row by columns in descending order.\n    \n    Examples:\n    get_row([\n      [1,2,3,4,5,6],\n      [1,2,3,4,1,6],\n      [1,2,3,4,5,1]\n    ], 1) == [(0, 0), (1, 4), (1, 0), (2, 5), (2, 0)]\n    get_row([], 1) == []\n    get_row([[], [1], [1, 2, 3]], 3) == [(2, 2)]\n    \"\"\"\"\"\"\n    # Get the first row, and sort it by rows\n    first_row = []\n    for i in range(len(lst)):\n        # get the first row, and sort it by rows\n        first_row.append(lst[0])\n        first_row.sort()\n        # Get the first row, and sort it by columns\n        first_row = []\n        for j in range(len(lst[0])):"]]
