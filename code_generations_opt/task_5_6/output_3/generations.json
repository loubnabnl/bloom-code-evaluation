I'd rather see it in its own module.\n\nI don't think the name of the module is relevant at all.\nI disagree. It's more relevant than the name of the class. The module name is more likely to be what you search for, than the class name. The module is also the only thing you really export from your code. So it's the name of what you are publishing and to whom you are publishing. The class name is just a name. You may know what you have called your class, but if someone else needs to use it, you'll have to tell them the name.

You have a list of numbers that you can push new numbers onto, and you can pop them off in any order you want. (The implementation doesn't do anything about popping them off in order, of course.)\n\nThat's not a stack, a stack should be able to be used recursively.\n\nWhen I was a kid, I was really interested in how programming languages are implemented. I wondered how they did \"if\", \"for\", etc. I can't remember exactly when I asked my dad, but he explained the concept of a stack and a queue. I remember thinking, \"that's dumb, just keep a list and push and pop when you need to.\"\n\nThat's actually how many programming languages implement \"for\" and \"if\".\nIn fact, you can create \"if\" statements that are implemented with a stack. I can't remember the exact syntax, but in the language used in one", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" Insert a number 'delimeter' between every two consecutive elements of input list `numbers'\n    >>> intersperse([], 4)\n    []\n    >>> intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4)\n    [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    for n, i in enumerate(numbers):\n       if i + 1 > delimeter:\n          numbers.append(i)\n   \n\nCool, but not the cleverest code.

This looks like it has a couple of advantages:\n* It's unambiguous\n* It doesn't require knowing the module names to import\n* It has an obvious use case - initializing the namespace for a function or method\n\nI'm not sure it's unambiguous.\n\nUnambiguous as in \"it tells you what the function does\".\n\nAh, of course.

Note that it works with any Delimeter. It\nis not \"tail-recursive\" though, and so won't perform as well on\ncomputers that don't support tail recursion.

The only reason it exists is so that all Python programmers know what to do when they see the syntax:\nfrom something import something\nIt was added to the language very late in the development process (after the language had been implemented), and it's easy to see why it was:\nfrom os import *\nfrom time import *\nfrom functools import *\netc.\n\nIt may not be an efficient one, but it is quite convenient.

Or maybe they are upset that the OP's code is actually not useful.\n\nIt's a common idiom in python to use lists where a deque (or other collection type) would be more appropriate.\nThe idea is that since deques are pretty much the same as lists, they're easier to get right. I think this is a bad idea in python though, because a deque requires much more care and understanding to get right than a list.\nA good example is with list comprehensions. It's much easier to mess up a comprehension involving a deque than a comprehension involving a list.\n\nI am not sure why the OP chose to show this.

It shows that you understand the importance of using the correct data structure for the job, which is the biggest issue I see with new programmers.\nIt also shows a very subtle, but important, difference in semantics between Python and other languages. The difference is that Python's intersperse function is actually returning a new list object, whereas in other languages the return value of intersperse is a list object with its contents interspersed between every other element.\nThe Python intersperse function seems like it would be the correct choice, until you consider the following example:\nimport time", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" Insert a number 'delimeter' between every two consecutive elements of input list `numbers'\n    >>> intersperse([], 4)\n    []\n    >>> intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4)\n    [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    if len(numbers) == 0:\n        return List()\n    numbers.append(numbers[-1])\n    while numbers:\n        for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):\n           numbers[i-1] = intersperse(numbers[i], delimeter)\n        numbers\n\n(This is Python 3, but the example isn't.)\n\nRight. Is this really an \"example of how to use Python\" if it doesn't work without importing the module you're giving an example of?\n\nMost people would consider a language to be an example of how to use it if it had at least one example that worked.\n\n\"most people\"?\n\nI meant to say, \"I consider a language to be an example of how to use it if it had at least one example that worked.\"\n\nThe point of the example is to demonstrate how Python code can be elegant, if you want to get that across you need to be able to show it in the language.\nIf I gave you", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" Insert a number 'delimeter' between every two consecutive elements of input list `numbers'\n    >>> intersperse([], 4)\n    []\n    >>> intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4)\n    [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    for i, n in enumerate(numbers):\n        numbers[i] = intersperse(numbers[i], delimeter + 1)\n\nThat's not too bad. I was expecting a lot worse.\nThe reason why it isn't bad is because Python uses type inference in the same way that C++ does. So when you do:\nfor i, n in enumerate(numbers):\nnumbers[i] = intersperse(numbers[i], delimeter + 1)\nThe compiler infers that numbers must be a List, so the fact that you use 'numbers' in the function's argument list isn't actually necessary.\nI have to say, I really like the way Python handles type inference.\n\nI've never seen anything like this done with types. I always thought it was done by having a function that converts between a string and an integer and you just write\nnumbers = \"1 2 3\" interspersed_list = intersperse(numbers,1,3)\nin the Python code.

Go is a language that would allow the creation of a List", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" Insert a number 'delimeter' between every two consecutive elements of input list `numbers'\n    >>> intersperse([], 4)\n    []\n    >>> intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4)\n    [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    for i, x in enumerate(numbers) :\n        numbers.append(i + delimeter)\n    return numbers\n\nLists are so much better than tuples.\n\nThe type of the function is not very Pythonic. The function's return value is a tuple. The list is the parameter list.\n\nThe function's return value is a list, not a tuple. The body of the function is a tuple.\n\nI'm going to have to downvote you for this. The return type of the function is a tuple, it's just that the list is on the left side of the tuple and the tuple is on the right side. The function is equivalent to:", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" Insert a number 'delimeter' between every two consecutive elements of input list `numbers'\n    >>> intersperse([], 4)\n    []\n    >>> intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4)\n    [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return numbers.interleave(delimeter)</s>", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" Insert a number 'delimeter' between every two consecutive elements of input list `numbers'\n    >>> intersperse([], 4)\n    []\n    >>> intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4)\n    [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n\n    a = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        if n % 2 == 0:\n            intersperse(numbers, a + 1)\n        else:\n             delimeter += 1\n             a = a + 1\n    return a</s>", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" Insert a number 'delimeter' between every two consecutive elements of input list `numbers'\n    >>> intersperse([], 4)\n    []\n    >>> intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4)\n    [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n\nThis is awesome! It's trivial, but I'll use it every day for small things like this.\n\nNot sure what you mean by trivial, but I wouldn't call it _useful_. This isn't going to save any time, and it's not going to be any easier to read than just using a for loop or two.\n\nWhy do you want to save time when you're programming? Isn't the goal to do something? It's not that it's going to save time, but it's going to make me code a lot easier to read. It's not like I'm going to be using this on the daily, but it's a nice function that I'll use once in a while.\n\nWhy do you want to read code in the first place? If the code is easy to read, then you can more quickly understand what it does.\n\nI agree that it's not going to make the code _better_, but it's not going to make it _worse_, and if it makes it easier to read, then it will make it easier to understand as well.\n\nYes, I agree that it won't make it worse.\n\nI would be interested in hearing some of the", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" Insert a number 'delimeter' between every two consecutive elements of input list `numbers'\n    >>> intersperse([], 4)\n    []\n    >>> intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4)\n    [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    for i in range(len(numbers)):\n       if i % 2 == 0:\n          numbers[i % 2 + 1] = numbers[i] + 1\n       else:\n          numbers[i % 2 + 1] = numbers[i % 2 - 1] + 1\n    return numbers", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" Insert a number 'delimeter' between every two consecutive elements of input list `numbers'\n    >>> intersperse([], 4)\n    []\n    >>> intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4)\n    [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    result = []\n    for i in numbers:\n       if i == 0:\n          result.append(i)\n    delimeter = i\n    numbers.append(i)\n    return result</s>", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" Insert a number 'delimeter' between every two consecutive elements of input list `numbers'\n    >>> intersperse([], 4)\n    []\n    >>> intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4)\n    [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    for i in range(0, len(numbers) - 1):\n        numbers.append(i)\n    if delimeter == 0:\n        numbers.append(i + delimeter)\n    return numbers\n\nYikes. This example is a perfect illustration of why overloading an operator can be a very bad idea.\n\nYou can implement this more succinctly using Python's iterators and `itertools.tee`:\n>>> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n>>> intersperse(numbers, 4)\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n>>> intersperse(numbers.itertools.tee(0), 4)\n[4, 2, 4, 1, 3]\n>>> intersperse(numbers.itertools.tee(4), 4)\n[1, 4, 2, 4, 3]\n\nFrom the title I was expecting some sort of prefix notation extension of Python.\n\nMe too.

I have to use a for-loop and do it manually.\nAlso, the assignment syntax is different for lists and tuples. I can't use += with lists, I have to use the += operator.\n\nActually, you can do it with map() by using a generator expression.\n>>> map(lambda x: x**2, [1,2,3]) [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]\n\nThat's the only way to use", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" Insert a number 'delimeter' between every two consecutive elements of input list `numbers'\n    >>> intersperse([], 4)\n    []\n    >>> intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4)\n    [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    delimeters = List(delimeter)\n    for i in range(len(numbers)):\n        numbers = numbers[:-i] + numbers[i+1:-i]\n        for j in range(2, len(delimeters)):\n            if j == 0:\n                 numbers.append(delimeters[j])\n         else:\n                 numbers.append(numbers[j] + delimeters[j+1])\n    return numbers\n\nWow, that's quite cool. I wonder if the concept could be extended to lists of any type, and if so whether it'd become useful for any real world problems.\n\nIf you can define a function on a list, you can apply that function to intersperse that list. For example, if you have a list of booleans and you want to intersperse them with a random number, you could do:", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" Insert a number 'delimeter' between every two consecutive elements of input list `numbers'\n    >>> intersperse([], 4)\n    []\n    >>> intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4)\n    [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    delimeter_count = 0\n    for i in range(numbers.length):\n        if numbers[i]!= delimeter:\n           delimeter_count += 1\n        numbers.append(numbers[i], numbers[i+1])\n    return list(delimeter_count)\n\nThis is obviously a contrived example, but in real code it's really hard to pick out the actual call to intersperse, and the delimeter_count variable is so easy to forget about.\n\nI'm not a Python programmer, but this looks like an anti-pattern to me.\nThe problem is that the intersperse function has to handle both the case where the input is a single list of integers, and the case where the input is a list of integers, and a delimeter.\nIn the former case, it's a no-op.\nIn the latter, it's a no-op.\nAnd even when it's doing something, the delimeter can't be null, so it has to check to see if it exists.\nOn the other", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" Insert a number 'delimeter' between every two consecutive elements of input list `numbers'\n    >>> intersperse([], 4)\n    []\n    >>> intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4)\n    [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    for i in numbers:\n        numbers.append(i+delimeter)\n\nYou can do even better:", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" Insert a number 'delimeter' between every two consecutive elements of input list `numbers'\n    >>> intersperse([], 4)\n    []\n    >>> intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4)\n    [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    if n in numbers:\n       n  = n + 1\n    for i in range(n):\n       n  = i * delimeter\n    return numbers\n\nThat's much better than the lambda solution.\nHowever, in some circumstances you might need to maintain the order of the elements in the output list.

I bet there's a lot of useful stuff out there that gets overlooked by people who have been around the block a few times.\n\nIt's a nice tip, but this is not the first place I look when I need an insertion sort. I would have posted this in /r/learnpython for a beginner.\n\nWho's saying it's a tip for insertion sort? It's a tip for interspersing elements in a list.\nI'm not sure how often it's relevant, but there are times where it's a really elegant way of doing", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" Insert a number 'delimeter' between every two consecutive elements of input list `numbers'\n    >>> intersperse([], 4)\n    []\n    >>> intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4)\n    [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    for i in numbers:\n        if i + delimeter == len(numbers):\n            numbers.append(i)\n    return numbers\n\nI don't know Python, but I do know some other languages. This would be a terrible way to handle this in any language I know of. I've never seen it done in any language I know of. If I had to guess, this is some early Python code, and that's why the language hasn't evolved to have a better built in way of doing it.\nI've been writing code in Python for a while now, and I'm still not sure I understand the rationale for using list comprehension so much. It's a handy tool, but it doesn't seem to be the best tool for the job. For this kind of thing, I would think a generator function would be better. If you have to keep the list anyways, you might as well make it more convenient to use.\n\nI agree. For most uses of list comprehensions, I find it's best to use generator functions.\n\nList comprehensions are a better way to handle complex lists (lists of lists", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" Insert a number 'delimeter' between every two consecutive elements of input list `numbers'\n    >>> intersperse([], 4)\n    []\n    >>> intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4)\n    [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n\nI don't get it.

Thanks for the feedback!\n\nI guess I'm a little bit of a Python purist, but this code is a little on the \"magic\" side for me.

A lot of the \"magic\" of python is in it's method names.

List[int] is the same thing as [int] list. But list comprehensions are more flexible because they work for any iterable, whereas the built in list type is limited to lists. So is there a benefit to using list[int] in Python 3?\n\nList comprehensions are more flexible than Python 2's list type, but they're _less_ flexible than Python 3's built-in list type.\n\nDoes anyone know of any good examples of lists in Python that demonstrate the power of lists and their general applicability?\nI've played with lists in Python for years but I'm still not a big fan of them.

I think it's because the syntax of Python is so flexible that people feel the need to abuse it to be able to express some idea which doesn't really fit.\nThe 'problem' with the code above is that it only works if the delimeter is a number. If the delimeter is, say, '_' (an underscore), the delimeter is interpreted as a string instead of a number.\nThe correct way to express the concept is to use the standard Python _format_ function:\n>>> format(numbers[0:2], \"%.2f\")[2] 2\nThe OP's code is also just a slight variant of the classic 'open- bracket-close-bracket-open-bracket-close-bracket-open-bracket", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" Insert a number 'delimeter' between every two consecutive elements of input list `numbers'\n    >>> intersperse([], 4)\n    []\n    >>> intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4)\n    [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" Insert a number 'delimeter' between every two consecutive elements of input list `numbers'\n    >>> intersperse([], 4)\n    []\n    >>> intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4)\n    [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n\nDoes anybody actually do that?
