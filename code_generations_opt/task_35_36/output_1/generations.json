It's not a bad solution, but it's not very idiomatic Python.  It's also not very efficient.  The built-in max() function is much faster.\nI'm not sure what you mean by \"idiomatic Python\".  I don't think there's any such thing.  I'm not sure what you mean by \"not very efficient\".  It's a single function call.  It's not like it's doing a lot of work.
