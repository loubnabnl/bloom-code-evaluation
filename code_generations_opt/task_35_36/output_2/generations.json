In particular, I think it's bad practice to write a function that relies on a class attribute of a base class.

If you change the class of the list from list to dict, max_element() will return the dict's max element. The worst case is that the list is changed to a class that does not support max() at all, such as string.

If the list is a list of doubles then you would get a float as result.\n\nIt is a good solution for the problem. A better solution would be to use a more flexible data type like a tuple.\n\nThe title is misleading. It's not about \"max element\", but about \"max element in a list\".\n\nI was hoping to see something about the max element of a list of integers.\n\nThis is the way I do it in Python:", "def max_element(l: list):\n    \"\"\"Return maximum element in the list.\n    >>> max_element([1, 2, 3])\n    3\n    >>> max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])\n    123\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    if len(l) == 1:\n       return l[0]\n    else:\n       return max(l[::-1], key=lambda item: item[0])\n    def max_element_by_key(l: list):\n    \"\"\"Return maximum element in the list for a given key.\n    >>> max_element_by_key([1, 2, 3])\n    3\n    >>> max_element_by_key([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])\n    123\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(l) == 1:\n       return l[0]\n    else:\n       return max(l[::-1], key=lambda item: item[0])\n    def max_element_by_key_and_value(l: list, key: key, value: value):\n    \"\"\"Return maximum element in the list for", "def max_element(l: list):\n    \"\"\"Return maximum element in the list.\n    >>> max_element([1, 2, 3])\n    3\n    >>> max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])\n    123\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    if len(l) == 1:\n        return l[0]\n    elif len(l) == 2:\n        return l[1]\n    elif len(l) == 3:\n        return l[2]\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"List must have at least 3 elements\")\nThis is a bad example, because the only case where it returns an error is when the list is empty, and that's what you're testing for.</s>", "def max_element(l: list):\n    \"\"\"Return maximum element in the list.\n    >>> max_element([1, 2, 3])\n    3\n    >>> max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])\n    123\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return max(l)\nI don't think that's the most efficient way to do it. If you have an array with 10 elements, and you want to find the maximum element, you can do it in O(n) time with a simple loop.       for x in list:           if x > max_element(list):               return x              return list[x]\nIf you're using Python, it's actually O(1).       max(list)  Note that max() is implemented as a C extension, so it's not available in the Python standard library.</s>", "def max_element(l: list):\n    \"\"\"Return maximum element in the list.\n    >>> max_element([1, 2, 3])\n    3\n    >>> max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])\n    123\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return l.max()\n    def min_element(l: list):\n    \"\"\"Return minimum element in the list.\n    >>> min_element([1, 2, 3])\n    1\n    >>> min_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])\n    9\n    \"\"\"\n    return l.min()"]]
