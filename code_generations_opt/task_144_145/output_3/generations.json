The first thing you will notice is that Python uses indentation to indicate where to start a statement and where to end one. In this case, there are no spaces between the opening brace { and the following opening brace }. Also, there is no space between the opening brace and the colon following it. This is important because it is used to create the iterative loop as seen in the code above. The second thing you will notice is the use of white space to surround the control structure (if, for, while, etc.). In this case, white space is used to indicate where the control structure begins and ends. So in the case of the for loop, the opening brace { is followed by a colon and then the body of the for loop. The closing brace } is followed by a comma and the end of the for loop. The third thing you will notice is the use of parenthesis to delineate the arguments to a function call.

I'm wondering if it could be generalized to 'nested' simplifications. The idea would be to provide a function to simplify a given expression in its entirety, and then use it recursively to simplify individual expressions, which would then be passed on to the function to be further simplified.\n\nThis is actually a really interesting idea. I'm not sure how it would play out with floating point numbers though.\n\nYou could do it in the same way, but you'd have to pass in the precision and scale. That would probably complicate the function a lot, and it wouldn't be worth it for anything but really long expressions.\n\nThere's probably a way to do this in Python using list comprehensions, I'm just not sure how.\n\nI think this is the opposite of a hack. It's very elegant. It's also very simple and", "def simplify(x, n):\n    \"\"\"Your task is to implement a function that will simplify the expression\n    x * n.

I don't see any advantage to using floats to represent the fraction. It doesn't seem to make it more readable or anything.\n\nAnother thing to note is that for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) (which is essentially what simplify() is doing) is guaranteed to loop exactly 10 times.\nfloat i = 0.1; while (i < 10) { i += 1; }\nisn't guaranteed to loop that many times.\n\nI don't see how it's guaranteed to loop exactly 10 times. It's not even guaranteed to loop the same number of times.\n\nHow often do you see a float value that isn't a number?\nI know this is pretty much a joke now, but I've always wondered why people don't just use a real programming language for the web.
