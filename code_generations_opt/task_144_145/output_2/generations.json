For example, the second example can be simplified to\n\n2/1\n\nand the third example can be simplified to\n\n10/2\n\nIf you want to be more clever about it, you could use the fact that the denominator is equal to the numerator multiplied by the denominator. In the first example, the numerator is 5 and the denominator is 1, so the numerator is 5 times 1, or 5. In the second example, the numerator is 1 and the denominator is 6, so the numerator is 1 times 6, or 6. In the third example, the numerator is 10 and the denominator is 2, so the numerator is 10 times 2, or 20.\n\nIn other words, the denominator can be computed by multiplying the numerator by the denominator, so if you want to simplify a", "def simplify(x, n):\n    \"\"\"Your task is to implement a function that will simplify the expression\n    x * n.
