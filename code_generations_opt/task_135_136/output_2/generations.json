If you want to use Python's built-in list types, you need to understand that they are not \"natural\" and that they are not meant to be used directly.\n\nThe list comprehension in Python is a very powerful tool. In fact, it is so powerful that it can be used to create very complicated data structures. However, if you don't understand the limitations of Python's list types, you can easily create a data structure that will cause your program to crash.\n\nFor example, suppose you have the following list of integers:\n\n>>> [1,2,3,", "def can_arrange(arr):\n    \"\"\"Create a function which returns the largest index of an element which\n    is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it.

I think it's because the author was trying to optimize the code for Python 2.x, and in Python 2.x, if you have a single-element list, it's faster to return -1 than to return the index of the first element.\n\nAh, I see.\n\nIt's a little faster on Python 3.x as well, since the if statement can be inlined.\n\nI have a question about the use of the lambda function in this context.\n\nI'm not sure what you're asking. Can you rephrase?\n\nWhy is the lambda function used instead of a simple function?\n\nIn Python, lambda is a function that takes exactly one argument. In this case, the argument is the function that takes the array and returns the largest index of an element that is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it. In this case, the lambda is a function that takes a single argument, arr,", "def can_arrange(arr):\n    \"\"\"Create a function which returns the largest index of an element which\n    is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it.
