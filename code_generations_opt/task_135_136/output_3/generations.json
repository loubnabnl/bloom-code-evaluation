We needed an algorithm to efficiently evaluate the game state, and, well, I was the only Python programmer there, so I was tasked with writing it.\nThis problem is exactly the sort of problem that can be solved with a simple recursive solution, but the problem I had was that the arrays would be random, so the index might end up being one index greater than the largest index, or two indexes greater, or any value in-between.
