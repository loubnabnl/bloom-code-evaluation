The problem is that the string representation of a number is not necessarily the same as the number itself.  For example, the string representation of 8 is \"8\", but the number 8 is not equal to \"8\".  The string representation of 8 is \"8\" because the number 8 is in base 10.  If you change the base to 3, then the string representation of 8 is \"22\".  The number 8 is not equal to \"22\".  The number 8 is equal to \"8\".  The string representation of 8 is \"8\" because the number 8 is in base 10.  If you change the base to 3, then the string representation of 8 is \"22\".  The number 8 is not equal to \"22\".  The number 8 is equal to \"8\".\n\nI think you're missing the point. The point is to change the base of the number, not the string representation.\n\nI think you're missing the point.
