It's a one-line solution, or a one-line function, that can solve the given problem. For example, the first one-liner, _solve_, is a solution to the problem \"given a string, reverse its case or keep it as is\".\nThere are many more one-liners in the Python documentation, and many more in the comments of Hacker News.\n\nTo me a one-liner is a piece of code that does something that could be written as a one-liner in some language. For example, in C:\nwhile(1) { printf(\"%s\", \"\\n\\n\"); }\nis a one-liner.
