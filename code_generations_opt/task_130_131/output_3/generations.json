It shows the difference between an interview and a homework question - the interviewer is not going to explain to you how to code up a Fibonacci sequence.\n\nAnd also, the interviewer is not going to tell you exactly what he or she is looking for in your answer. So you should be ready to turn out a number of solutions and, in the interview, choose one that fits the context.</s>"]]
