Why not just take the date string and do some kind of sanity-check against an actual calendar?\n\nBecause it is a great example of what is expected in this simple example.\n\nAh, I see.

The function had to take an arbitrary integer N, return true if it was a prime, and output the next prime number after the one you asked for.\nTo make it harder, he limited the function to only take up to a certain number of arguments and output in a specific format. I forget the exact limitations, but it was definitely not easy to get the answers right.
