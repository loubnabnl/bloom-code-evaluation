The problem is that it's very easy to write a program that will be able to pass this test, but which will be a security hole.\nFor example, if I have a file called \"malicious.txt\", it will pass the check.\n\nI agree. The problem is that you can't really check if a file is a file, or a directory, or a symlink, or a program, or a script, or what have you, without knowing the details of the file system.\n\nI think this is more of a problem with the way the file system is designed. If there was a way to just check if a file is a valid filename, then this would be a much easier task.\n\nThe file system is designed to allow for all kinds of things.\nThe file system is also designed to allow for the possibility of a user doing things like this, and then doing something stupid.\n\nI think this is a great idea.", "def file_name_check(file_name):\n    \"\"\"Create a function which takes a string representing a file's name, and returns\n    'Yes' if the the file's name is valid, and returns 'No' otherwise.\n    A file's name is considered to be valid if and only if all the following conditions \n    are met:\n    - There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.\n    - The file's name contains exactly one dot '.'\n    - The substring before the dot should not be empty, and it starts with a letter from \n    the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').\n    - The substring after the dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']\n    Examples:\n    file_name_check(\"example.txt\") # => 'Yes'\n    file_name_check(\"1example.dll\") # => 'No' (the name should start with a latin alphapet letter)\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return re.match(r'^(?P<file_name>[0-9]+)$', file_name_check_function)\n\nFile name validation is a common task in Python.  The problem is that there are many ways to validate a file name.  The Python documentation recommends that you use the re module to validate the file name.  The re module is part of the standard library and it provides a function called match which can be used to validate a string.  The problem with using the re module is that you have to know the regular expression for validating a file name.  The regular expression is not part of the re module and you have to know it.  This tutorial will show you how to write a function which will validate a file name.  The function will take a string and will return either Yes or No depending on whether the string is valid or not.  The function will validate the file name using a regular expression.\n\nThe first step is to create a function called file_name_check which will validate a file name.  The function will take a string and will return Yes or No depending on whether the string is valid or not.  The function will validate the file name", "def file_name_check(file_name):\n    \"\"\"Create a function which takes a string representing a file's name, and returns\n    'Yes' if the the file's name is valid, and returns 'No' otherwise.\n    A file's name is considered to be valid if and only if all the following conditions \n    are met:\n    -
