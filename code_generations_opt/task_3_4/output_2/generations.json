But I think you're missing the point of the article.\nThe point is that the above is a _bad_ example of the code smell. The code smell is that you're doing a lot of work (an if-then-else) to handle a case that is essentially never going to happen, but which you're forced to handle anyway.\n\nI think the point of the article is that a lot of people have a tendency to write code like this, but the code is not necessarily bad.\n\nThis is a classic example of why you shouldn't do that.\n\nI think you missed the point of the article.\n\nI think you missed the point of my comment.\n\nI think you missed the point of his comment.\n\nI think you missed the point of my comment", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:\n    \"\"\" You're given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with\n    zero balance.

Is this a joke? I'm not familiar with python but this seems like a joke.\n\nThis is an exercise from the book \"Think like a Computer Scientist\" by Daniel Shiffman. I think the exercise was meant to make the reader aware of the difference between a list of integers and a list of operations, and the implications of that.\n\nAnd what are the implications?\n\nWell, a list of integers is a list of numbers, like:\n1, 2, 3\nA list of operations is a list of things you can do to an object, like:\n+,-,/,*,%\nSo the difference is that a list of integers is a list of numbers, and a list of operations is a list of things you can do to an object.\n\nThe exercise is meant to show that lists of operations can be thought of as lists of integers.\n\nThere is a mistake in the code. The line below_zero(oper", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:\n    \"\"\" You're given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with\n    zero balance.

The idea is that you have a collection of items, and you need to find a subset that has a certain property.  In this case, the property is that the total value of the items in the subset is less than a certain value.\nYou might have heard of the \"knapsack problem\" in the context of the traveling salesman problem.  If you have a set of cities, and you want to find the shortest tour that visits each city exactly once, then the problem is exactly the same as the \"below zero\" function.  The difference is that the \"below zero\" function is much easier to solve.\n\nThis is not a bad idea, it's a great one.\nThe question is: how to solve the problem.\nI think the solution to the problem is to use a dynamic programming solution. I've seen an implementation of this solution, but can't find it right now.\n\nThere are lots of solutions to the problem, but the", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:\n    \"\"\" You're given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with\n    zero balance.

It does not detect if the balance falls below zero, it detects if the balance is less than the number of elements in the list.\nThis is a huge difference. The balance can fall below zero but still not be less than the number of operations.\n\nThis is a good point.\nI'd probably take a different approach, which is to say that the balance is always a positive number, and that the function will return True if and only if the number of operations is greater than the balance.\n\nYou're still not detecting if the balance is negative.\n\nTrue, but the point of the article is to show that the solution is simple. The point of the exercise is to show that the solution is not obvious, which it's not.\n\nI think the solution is obvious, and it's not simple.\n\nI think the solution is obvious, and it is simple.\n\nThis is a good point", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:\n    \"\"\" You're given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with\n    zero balance.
