The trick in this case is to remember that subtraction is the same thing as negation, so we're actually trying to find the first non-negative number in the list.\nThe list is ordered from smallest to largest, so the first element is smallest and the second element is the largest.\nThe example in the article is interesting because it's a bit contrived and in the real world you'd probably have a more natural way to specify the problem.\n\nSeems like the author has missed the real problem. The real problem is that the first element of the list is positive, and the second element is negative. Instead of trying to find the \"first non-negative\" number in the list, the correct way to solve this problem is to keep track of the differences between the largest and smallest element, and then check to see if the difference ever goes negative.\n\nThis is a very contrived example.

The point of the exercise is to highlight the difference between an object in Python, and an object in JavaScript.\nIn Python, if you know how to do operations on integers, you can figure out how to do operations on a list of integers. There are no special methods or functions for working on lists, because lists are just objects.\nIn JavaScript, the list object is special, and there's an extra layer of complexity to using it. You have to know about functions that \"give back\" lists, and functions that \"take away\" lists, and they have to be called in different ways depending on which kind of list you want.\n\nI don't agree.

But the article's point is that the problem is trivial in Python and trivial in (almost) every other popular programming language. That's why Python code is shown.\n\nThe problem with this is, it's not a functional problem.\nYou're not asking for'sum of all operations of positive number', you're asking for 'if balance is positive, sum of all operations, else, sum of all operations less last one'.\nThe solution in the article is very inefficient.\n\nYou can easily have a language without functions (in the Lisp sense) and still have this be a functional problem. It's a question of being able to build an abstract operation by combining functions together. (Of course, this is not true of Lisp-style functional languages, which have both functions and macros, but there are", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:\n    \"\"\" You're given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account that starts with\n    zero balance.

I'm assuming that the operations are executed in order, and that the result of each operation is simply the balance after the operation (ie. if the account had a balance of 1 before the first operation, the first operation should return a result of 2). The example code above is O(n) in the number of operations, but I think it can be reduced to O(n^2).\nIn order to find the point in the list at which the account balance falls below zero, you would need to find the smallest positive number for which the result of the operation is less than zero. Then, you can just check the operation before that, and so on. The order of operations isn't important, since we're assuming that the balance doesn't change after each operation.\nThis can be done by maintaining a list of positive numbers that we've seen, and maintaining the current minimum value. When we find the smallest number that is less than zero, we can simply call the operation with the previous minimum value.\nThis takes O(n) time, since it's not possible to determine the smallest positive number in O(n) time.

I can't recommend it. It's a good way to get in the habit of doing things \"in the way you're used to\", but it's not a good way to learn how to program.\n\nI agree. When learning a language I always recommend to avoid typing imports until you understand the language enough to know that the import is not for a function that exists in the language but rather a library function that can be used.\nAlso the way Python handles imports is a little weird. It's not like Java, C#, or PHP where you can just have a package.js, package.php, package.cs, and call it a day. In Python you can have 2 libraries named the same thing (like \"collections.sort\" and \"collections\" which is a builtin) and if you import \"collections\" then you're importing both of them. It can get confusing if you don't know what you're doing.\n\nThis is called an import _path_ and it's not unique to Python.
