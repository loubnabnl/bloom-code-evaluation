Why does the decimal to binary mapping not necessarily have a unique representation?\n\nIt's because the integers between 0 and 1 are in a one-to-one correspondence with the integers between 0 and 2^32 -1.\ne.g. 10 = 2^4 - 1, 100 = 2^5 - 1, 1000 = 2^6 - 1, 10000 = 2^7 - 1,..., 32000 = 2^32 - 1\nWhen you have a one-to-one correspondence you can assign each of the integers in the one-to-many correspondence a different _value_, but you can't assign them different _numbers_.
