sum(lst)\n\nThere is an interesting variation of this problem which is that you have a list of integers, and you need to find the sum of all their digits. This problem is NP-complete.\n\nI'm not sure if it's NP-complete.\nThe Wikipedia page for the sum of digits problem says that it is NP-complete for the case where the list is sorted. However, the problem as stated by the OP does not require that the list be sorted.\n\nI'm not sure if it's NP-complete either, but I think it's a fun problem to consider.\nThe Wikipedia page says that the problem is NP-complete for the case where the list is sorted, but it also says that there are some algorithms which are polynomial in the length of the list. I'm not sure if there are any polynomial time algorithms for the case where the list is not sorted, but it seems like an interesting problem.\n\nI've always thought that the sum of the digits of", "def skjkasdkd(lst):\n    \"\"\"You are given a list of integers.\n    You need to find the largest prime value and return the sum of its digits.\n\n    Examples:\n    For lst = [0,3,2,1,3,5,7,4,5,5,5,2,181,32,4,32,3,2,32,324,4,3] the output should be 10\n    For lst = [1,0,1,8,2,4597,2,1,3,40,1,2,1,2,4,2,5,1] the output should be 25\n    For lst = [1,3,1,32,5107,34,83278,109,163,23,2323,32,30,1,9,3] the output should be 13\n    For lst = [0,724,32,71,99,32,6,0,5,91,83,0,5,6] the output should be 11\n    For lst = [0,81,12,3,1,21] the output should be 3\n    For lst = [0,8,1,2,1,7] the output should be 7\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"", "def skjkasdkd(lst):\n    \"\"\"You are given a list of integers.\n    You need to find the largest prime value and return the sum of its digits.\n\n    Examples:\n    For lst = [0,3,2,1,3,5,7,4,5,5,5,2,181,32,4,32,3,2,32,324,4,3] the output should be 10\n    For lst = [1,0,1,8,2,4597,2,1,3,40,1,2,1,2,4,2,5,1] the output should be 25\n    For lst = [1,3,1,32,5107,34,83278,109,163,23,2323,32,30,1,9,3] the output should be 13\n    For lst = [0,724,32,71,99,32,6,0,5,91,83,0,5,6] the output should be 11\n    For lst = [0,81,12,3,1,21] the output should be 3\n    For lst = [0,8,1,2,1,7] the output should be 7\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    if len(lst) == 1:\n        return 0\n    else:\n        return sum(lst[0] for lst in lst)\n\nI'm not sure why you're using Python.
