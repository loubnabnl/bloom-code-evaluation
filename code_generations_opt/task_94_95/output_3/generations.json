(and I'm loving it!). My main use for it is for server-side applications. I've had the need to write functions that can operate on large data sets. In the past, I've always used Perl to solve this problem. I've learned some interesting things writing a functional version in Python.\n\nFunctional programming is still not mainstream in Python. As I was writing this function, I had to do some research to discover what was available to me. I ended up using generator expressions, list comprehension and map() to solve this problem. Once I understood the language better, I was able to write this in a fairly concise manner.\n\nThis function does not use any global state, and does not make any global changes to the scope. It's the kind of code that a programmer would find useful in the real world.</s>", "def skjkasdkd(lst):\n    \"\"\"You are given a list of integers.\n    You need to find the largest prime value and return the sum of its digits.\n\n    Examples:\n    For lst = [0,3,2,1,3,5,7,4,5,5,5,2,181,32,4,32,3,2,32,324,4,3] the output should be 10\n    For lst = [1,0,1,8,2,4597,2,1,3,40,1,2,1,2,4,2,5,1] the output should be 25\n    For lst = [1,3,1,32,5107,34,83278,109,163,23,2323,32,30,1,9,3] the output should be 13\n    For lst = [0,724,32,71,99,32,6,0,5,91,83,0,5,6] the output should be 11\n    For lst = [0,81,12,3,1,21] the output should be 3\n    For lst = [0,8,1,2,1,7] the output should be 7\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"", "def skjkasdkd(lst):\n    \"\"\"You are given a list of integers.\n    You need to find the largest prime value and return the sum of its digits.\n\n    Examples:\n    For lst = [0,3,2,1,3,5,7,4,5,5,5,2,181,32,4,32,3,2,32,324,4,3] the output should be 10\n    For lst = [1,0,1,8,2,4597,2,1,3,40,1,2,1,2,4,2,5,1] the output should be 25\n    For lst = [1,3,1,32,5107,34,83278,109,163,23,2323,32,30,1,9,3] the output should be 13\n    For lst = [0,724,32,71,99,32,6,0,5,91,83,0,5,6] the output should be 11\n    For lst = [0,81,12,3,1,21] the output should be 3\n    For lst = [0,8,1,2,1,7] the output should be 7\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    for i in lst:\n        if i is not None and not all(is_prime(i) for i in range(len(i) -
