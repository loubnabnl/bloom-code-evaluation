You're using a list of integers when an array of ints is almost always a better solution.\nIf you want to use a list, you should use a generator, which is built into python.\n\nThe output of \"python -c 'print sum(range(4))'\" is 24, which means that the list approach is exactly the same as the generator approach.\n\nYes, but range isn't built in and will be difficult to use in the future if you don't use the built in stuff.\n\nThe point of this was to demonstrate a way to use a generator with a list of integers. If the OP wanted to demonstrate the more general use of generators with lists, then I agree that a generator would have been a better choice.\n\nTrue, but I think he should have at least mentioned generators for future readers who may not know about them.\n\nIt might be good to use an array instead of a list (though that is not \"pythonic\") because then you can use range(2) instead of 0:2 which is faster.\n\nI would have used a list", "def add_elements(arr, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a non-empty array of integers arr and an integer k, return\n    the sum of the elements with at most two digits from the first k elements of arr.\n\n    Example:\n\n        Input: arr = [111,21,3,4000,5,6,7,8,9], k = 4\n        Output: 24 # sum of 21 + 3\n\n    Constraints:\n        1. 1 <= len(arr) <= 100\n        2. 1 <= k <= len(arr)\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    sum = 0\n    for i in range(1,len(arr)):\n        sum += arr[k:i+2]\n    return sum\n\nI don't think this is correct. Since the array is only of integers, the sum function will simply do integer addition, resulting in a number from -9 to +9.\n\nI was a little confused when I wrote it, but it's correct. Here's how I think of it:\nIn this particular case, the input numbers (111, 21, 3, 4000, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) are all positive. What this function is doing is selecting the first k elements of the input and adding them all together. The first k elements are 111, 21, 3, 4000, 5, 6, 7, and 8. The sum of those is 24.\n\nAh, I see what you're saying, but I think you need to change the way you explain it.
