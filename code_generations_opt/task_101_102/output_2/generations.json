I'm not sure what to do with the dictionary of words I'm returned.  Also, I don't really know what the other solutions are doing, so I'm not sure what my solution is missing.\nThe solution I came up with was to read the string, split it into words, then use the words to look up the dictionary entry.  I don't think the dictionary entry is necessary, so I left it out.  I then returned the words.\nThe dictionary entry is not necessary.  The dictionary is just there to give you a reference to the word.  If you don't need the reference, then you can just return the word.  I didn't think of that, but it makes sense.</s>", "def words_string(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    You will be given a string of words separated by commas or spaces.
