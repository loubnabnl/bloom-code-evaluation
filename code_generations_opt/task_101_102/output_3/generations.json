It sounds\nlike all you need is a list comprehension. If you want to learn how to\nuse list comprehensions, I suggest you read the tutorial at\n<http://docs.python.org/tut/list-comprehensions.html> and review the\nexamples at the end of the tutorial.\nThe second question is, why do you want to do it this way? What is it\nabout the way you have attempted to do it that you don't understand, so\nthat you need a function?\n\nThere are many ways", "def words_string(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    You will be given a string of words separated by commas or spaces.

Why?\n\nThe first example is taking \"Hi, my name is John\" and splitting it up. It\nreturns an array of words, then an empty string. The second example is\ntaking a string like \"One, two, three, four, five, six\" and joining it up\nwith all the words separated by a comma.\nIt's actually a little tricky to get the first example right.

This one is in there, but it's not the default.\n\\- Don't allow words that start with a letter or underscore, since that's usually the delimiter.
