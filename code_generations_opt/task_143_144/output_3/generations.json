One way to solve it is to make a dictionary of all the words that occur in the input sentence, and then iterate over the input sentence and search the dictionary for the longest common word. The longest common word is a word that occurs in the sentence with the longest occurrence of that word.\n\nFor example, in the sentence \"This is a test\", the longest common word is the word \"is\", which occurs five times. You can then use the longest common word to find the next longest common word, and then that word, and so on.\n\nPython", "def words_in_sentence(sentence):\n    \"\"\"\n    You are given a string representing a sentence,\n    the sentence contains some words separated by a space,\n    and you have to return a string that contains the words from the original sentence,\n    whose lengths are prime numbers,\n    the order of the words in the new string should be the same as the original one.\n\n    Example 1:\n        Input: sentence = \"This is a test\"\n        Output: \"is\"\n\n    Example 2:\n        Input: sentence = \"lets go for swimming\"\n        Output: \"go for\"\n\n    Constraints:\n        * 1 <= len(sentence) <= 100\n        * sentence contains only letters\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"", "def words_in_sentence(sentence):\n    \"\"\"\n    You are given a string representing a sentence,\n    the sentence contains some words separated by a space,\n    and you have to return a string that contains the words from the original sentence,\n    whose lengths are prime numbers,\n    the order of the words in the new string should be the same as the original one.\n\n    Example 1:\n        Input: sentence = \"This is a test\"\n        Output: \"is\"\n\n    Example 2:\n        Input: sentence = \"lets go for swimming\"\n        Output: \"go for\"\n\n    Constraints:\n        * 1 <= len(sentence) <= 100\n        * sentence contains only letters\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    def next_word(word):\n        return word % 2 == 0\n    def split_by_word(word, sentence):\n        return sentence.split(word, 1)\n    def append(word, len(sentence), next_word):\n        sentence.append(word, len(sentence))\n        if next_word is None:\n             sentence.append(word, len(sentence))\n         next_word = next_word.split_by_word(word, sentence)\n        if len(sentence) % 2 == 1:\n              append(word, len(sentence))\n         next_word = next_word.split_by_word(word, sentence)\n        if len(sentence) % 2 == 1:", "def words_in_sentence(sentence):\n    \"\"\"\n    You are given a string representing a sentence,\n    the sentence contains some words separated by a space,\n    and you have to return a string that contains the words from the original sentence,\n    whose lengths are prime numbers,\n    the order of the words in the new string should be the same as the original one.\n\n    Example 1:\n        Input: sentence = \"This is a test\"\n        Output: \"is\"\n\n    Example 2:\n        Input: sentence = \"lets go for swimming\"\n        Output: \"go for\"\n\n    Constraints:\n        * 1 <= len(sentence) <= 100\n        * sentence contains only letters\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n\n        for word in sentence:\n           if word not in [a, b, c]:\n               break\n             if word not in [a, b, c, d, e]:\n                break\n              if word not in [a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h]:\n                break\n              if word not in [a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l]:\n                break\n               if word not in [a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n,", "def words_in_sentence(sentence):\n    \"\"\"\n    You are given a string representing a sentence,\n    the sentence contains some words separated by a space,\n    and you have to return a string that contains the words from the original sentence,\n    whose lengths are prime numbers,\n    the order of the words in the new string should be the same as the original one.\n\n    Example 1:\n        Input: sentence = \"This is a test\"\n        Output: \"is\"\n\n    Example 2:\n        Input: sentence = \"lets go for swimming\"\n        Output: \"go for\"\n\n    Constraints:\n        * 1 <= len(sentence) <= 100\n        * sentence contains only letters\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n\n        def solution(sentence):\n           for word in sentence:\n                if word is not a punctuation mark or a space:\n                      if len(word) == 1:\n                             return word\n                            else:\n                               return word[2:]\n                                 return''", "def words_in_sentence(sentence):\n    \"\"\"\n    You are given a string representing a sentence,\n    the sentence contains some words separated by a space,\n    and you have to return a string that contains the words from the original sentence,\n    whose lengths are prime numbers,\n    the order of the words in the new string should be the same as the original one.\n\n    Example 1:\n        Input: sentence = \"This is a test\"\n        Output: \"is\"\n\n    Example 2:\n        Input: sentence = \"lets go for swimming\"\n        Output: \"go for\"\n\n    Constraints:\n        * 1 <= len(sentence) <= 100\n        * sentence contains only letters\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    #
