I think the most important thing to do is to figure out how to use the built-in string functions. You have to figure out how to use split() and lower(). You also have to figure out how to find the length of a string (len()) and how to find the length of a substring of a string (len(substring)). You also have to figure out how to find the length of a prime number (is_prime(n)).\n\nYou can probably solve this problem in one line of Python, but in C++ it might take you a few lines.\n\nI have a feeling that you might not be familiar with the concept of prime numbers. If that's the case, you might want to read up on them before continuing.\n\nThe problem you are trying to solve is actually a very simple one, but it is a good exercise to get you used to the way that strings work in C++.\n\nI don't know if you are familiar with regular expressions, but this problem is very similar to the classic \"regex challenge\" that you can find all over the internet.
