The question doesn't state what sort of data you're dealing with, it just asks you to write a function.\nA lot of people like to make a distinction between the two things you can do in a language: expression and computation. Expression is writing something that looks correct. Computation is writing something that works.\nIn this case, the function you wrote is an expression, and it's correct, but it doesn't compute anything, so it doesn't work.\nI'd probably come up with a function that accepts a list of strings and returns the sum of the lengths of the strings in the list.\n\nThe function does compute something.

You can describe what you want using \"tricks\" (in this case, a lambda). The code that's generated from the lambda and the argument it's given are the same.\nIn this case, the lambda takes two things as arguments: the list of strings, and the value being searched for in that list. It returns the result of calling the sum function with those two things as arguments. The result of calling sum, in turn, is the sorted list.\n\nI see. So I think I understand that lambda is like a 'function pointer' (a la C)?\n\nIt's more like a function object. In C, a function pointer is a type, and you can call a function pointer with different types. In Python, a function object is a type, and you can call it with different types.
