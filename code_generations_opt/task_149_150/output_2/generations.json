misleading. The problem is not to write a function that accepts a list of strings and returns a list of strings. The problem is to write a function that accepts a list of strings and returns a list of strings in sorted order.\n\nYou are right. I changed the question to make it clearer.\n\nI think it's still not clear. What is the function supposed to return? It's not a function that accepts a list of strings, but a function that accepts a list of strings and returns a list of strings in sorted order.\n\nI think it's still not clear.
