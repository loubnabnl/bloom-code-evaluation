It's O(log n) and is the fastest known algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor of two integers.\n\nI've read about it, but I still don't understand it.\n\nIt's a very simple algorithm. Basically, it works by splitting the integers into groups of two. Then, it computes the greatest common divisor of those two numbers. It then moves on to the next group of two.\nI can't find a good explanation, but I", "def is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"Return true if a given number is prime, and false otherwise.\n    >>> is_prime(6)\n    False\n    >>> is_prime(101)\n    True\n    >>> is_prime(11)\n    True\n    >>> is_prime(13441)\n    True\n    >>> is_prime(61)\n    True\n    >>> is_prime(4)\n    False\n    >>> is_prime(1)\n    False\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return True\n    if n == 2:\n        return True\n    if n == 3:\n        return True\n    if n == 5:\n        return True\n    if n == 7:\n        return True\n    if n == 11:\n        return True\n    if n == 13:\n        return True\n    if n == 17:\n        return True\n    if n == 19:\n        return True\n    if n == 23:\n        return True\n    if n == 29:\n        return True\n    if n == 31:\n        return True\n    if n == 37:\n        return True\n    if n == 41:", "def is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"Return true if a given number is prime, and false otherwise.\n    >>> is_prime(6)\n    False\n    >>> is_prime(101)\n    True\n    >>> is_prime(11)\n    True\n    >>> is_prime(13441)\n    True\n    >>> is_prime(61)\n    True\n    >>> is_prime(4)\n    False\n    >>> is_prime(1)\n    False\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return True\n    if n % 3 == 0:\n        return True\n    if n % 5 == 0:\n        return True\n    if n % 7 == 0:\n        return True\n    if n % 11 == 0:\n        return True\n    return False", "def is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"Return true if a given number is prime, and false otherwise.\n    >>> is_prime(6)\n    False\n    >>> is_prime(101)\n    True\n    >>> is_prime(11)\n    True\n    >>> is_prime(13441)\n    True\n    >>> is_prime(61)\n    True\n    >>> is_prime(4)\n    False\n    >>> is_prime(1)\n    False\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n\nI feel like this is a bad example.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause the first is_prime(6) will return False, and then it will return True for the next three examples.\n\nI think the point is to show that it's not a simple for loop.\n\nI'm not sure what your point is.
