I think the idea is correct, but the implementation is not. The function returns the collatz sequence of the argument, and the collatz sequence of a given number is the same number repeated a certain number of times. For example, 5 has a collatz sequence of [5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1] which means that 5 is repeated 5 times. However, the function returns [1, 5] which would imply that it returns 5 repeated 1 times. This would mean that 5 is odd, which is a contradiction. The solution is either wrong or the author didn't provide enough info.\"\n\nWell, it doesn't return the sequence, it returns a sorted list of odd numbers in the sequence.\n\nIn the first paragraph, the author explains that the Collatz conjecture is the following.\n_start with any positive integer n.
