I don't know what the hell `re.sub` is, and `List` is a list of lists, so what's the point of returning a list of lists of lists?\n\nThe \"return\" is a function call. The string is the first argument. The function returns a list of all the strings in the string.\n\nThanks, that makes sense now.\n\nI think you're being a bit too harsh on the OP.\nHe was just trying to show a simple example of how to use the \"from typing import List\" idiom.\nIn this case, he's using it to separate a string of nested parentheses into a list of strings.\nThe OP is not trying to be a Python expert.\n\nI was being harsh on the OP because the OP was being harsh on me. I don't have a problem with people who are trying to learn.\n\nI don't know what you're talking about. I was only trying to explain that the OP was trying to show a simple example of how to use the \"from typing import List\" idiom", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:\n    \"\"\" Input to this function is a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses. Your goal is to\n    separate those group into separate strings and return the list of those.\n    Separate groups are balanced (each open brace is properly closed) and not nested within each other\n    Ignore any spaces in the input string.\n    >>> separate_paren_groups('( ) (( )) (( )( ))')\n    ['()', '(())', '(()())']\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return list(map(str.strip, paren_string))\n\nNice. I would add a comment about the input being balanced, though.\n\nIf you use a language that doesn't have multiple statements in a single statement, like Python, you can use this:\nfrom typing import List", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:\n    \"\"\" Input to this function is a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses.

It's like a \"reverse unpack\" of sorts.</s>", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:\n    \"\"\" Input to this function is a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses.
