I thought \"join\" would join two strings together, but it's returning a string with a single character in it.\n\n\"join\" is an operator in Python that returns a string with all the characters of the first string appended to the end of the second string.\n\nAh, I see. Thanks.\n\nThat's not quite right. It returns a string with all the characters of the first string, concatenated together with a newline character.\n\nIs there a way to do this in a way that doesn't require a string?\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\nI mean, if you're going to do a bunch of things with the characters, why not just build a list?\n\nThe point of the exercise is to learn how to write an iterator. It's not so much about the specific implementation as it is about the process of writing one.\n\nI guess I just don't understand the purpose of an iterator in this case.\n\nThis is just a silly exercise, but there are real-world uses for iterators.
