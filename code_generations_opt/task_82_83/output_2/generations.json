This function will always return True for a string of length two. It is also highly likely that it will return True for a string of length three.\n\nAlso, in Python, the '%' operator is not the modulo operator.\n\nYou're right about the % operator.\n\nIf you want to write a function that returns True if the string length is a prime number, you should write a function that tests if the string length is divisible by the prime number.\n\nYou can do this by testing for the existence of a multiple of the prime number.\n\nFor example, if you want to test if a string is divisible by 7, you can test for the existence of a multiple of 7.

I think the problem is that people try to make their tests more complicated than they need to be.\n\nI agree. I see this a lot in my own tests.
