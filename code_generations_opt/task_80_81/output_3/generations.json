The reason for this is that one can easily find the condition to be met by the statement, and the conditions are grouped together.\n\nOf course, one can achieve the same effect with C-style code by using ternary operators. However, in the C style, there will be more lines of code, and the conditions will be scattered all over the place.\n\nAnother advantage of the Python style is that the code can be written in a more concise form.
