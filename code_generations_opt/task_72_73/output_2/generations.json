For example, the article mentions that the object will fly if the sum of its elements is less than or equal to the maximum weight. But what is the maximum weight?\nI would have expected this to be a little more involved.\n\nGood point. I just added a comment to the article.\n\nI'm still not sure what the maximum weight is. The article mentions that the maximum weight is \"the maximum weight of an object that can be lifted by a single human\", but that's not very helpful. I would have expected the maximum weight to be a function of the maximum lift (pounds) of a human, the density of the object, and the height of the human.\n\nIt is a function of the maximum lift of a human, the density of the object, and the height of the human.\n\nI found this a bit too simple, but that's probably because I know the answer.\nThe problem is that it's too easy to get the answer wrong.
