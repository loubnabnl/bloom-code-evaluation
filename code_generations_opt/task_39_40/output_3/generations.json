This is one of the advantages of the new HN feature that lets you submit links to other sites.\n\nI used this technique a couple of days ago for a problem that involved calculating whether or not a number is prime.\nIt worked very well for me.\n\nIt's very useful when you need to call a function with the same parameters many times, but the order of the parameters can change (e.g. Fibonacci sequence)</s>", "def prime_fib(n: int):\n    \"\"\"\n    prime_fib returns n-th number that is a Fibonacci number and it's also prime.\n    >>> prime_fib(1)\n    2\n    >>> prime_fib(2)\n    3\n    >>> prime_fib(3)\n    5\n    >>> prime_fib(4)\n    13\n    >>> prime_fib(5)\n    89\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    else:\n        return fib(n-1)+fib(n-2)\nThis is called `tail recursion', where the recursive call is at the end of the function.

You need to break the recursion.  I'd suggest an if statement there, rather than a return, but I don't know if that'd make a difference to the performance.

I think you have not read my code. The code is correct. I am sure about this.\nThe code is correct for integers. But your \"prime_fib\" function only works on integers. You use it to test whether a number is prime. In your test for n < 2 you check whether n is divisible by 2. But the Python documentation says that the integer division operator is commutative, so what you're really testing is whether n is divisible by 1.\nI am not sure that we have written about the same thing.", "def prime_fib(n: int):\n    \"\"\"\n    prime_fib returns n-th number that is a Fibonacci number and it's also prime.\n    >>> prime_fib(1)\n    2\n    >>> prime_fib(2)\n    3\n    >>> prime_fib(3)\n    5\n    >>> prime_fib(4)\n    13\n    >>> prime_fib(5)\n    89\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        raise ValueError(\"n must be an integer\")\n    return n", "def prime_fib(n: int):\n    \"\"\"\n    prime_fib returns n-th number that is a Fibonacci number and it's also prime.\n    >>> prime_fib(1)\n    2\n    >>> prime_fib(2)\n    3\n    >>> prime_fib(3)\n    5\n    >>> prime_fib(4)\n    13\n    >>> prime_fib(5)\n    89\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    def fib(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    fib returns n-th number in Fibonacci sequence.\n    >>> fib(1)\n    1\n    >>> fib(2)\n    2\n    >>> fib(3)\n    5\n    >>> fib(4)\n    8\n    >>> fib(5)\n    13\n    \"\"\"\n    return [n % fib(n - 1)]\n    + fib(n - 1)\nI'm surprised it works.\n\nI'm not, although I don't know why.\n\nYou can write a one-liner which uses python's built in function for prime numbers:\nimport random", "def prime_fib(n: int):\n    \"\"\"\n    prime_fib returns n-th number that is a Fibonacci number and it's also prime.\n    >>> prime_fib(1)\n    2\n    >>> prime_fib(2)\n    3\n    >>> prime_fib(3)\n    5\n    >>> prime_fib(4)\n    13\n    >>> prime_fib(5)\n    89\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    def primes = [2, 3, 5, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 151, 157, 163, 167, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 211, 233, 239, 241, 251, 257, 263, 269, 271, 277, 281, 283, 293, 307, 311, 313, 317, 331, 337, 349, 367, 383, 389, 419, 431, 439, 449, 459, 461, 467, 479, 487, 501, 511, 519, 523, 541, 543, 547, 553, 559, 571, 577, 583, 589, 593, 597, 607, 613, 617, 619, 641, 647, 659, 667, 671, 673, 677, 683, 689, 697, 701, 709,", "def prime_fib(n: int):\n    \"\"\"\n    prime_fib returns n-th number that is a Fibonacci number and it's also prime.\n    >>> prime_fib(1)\n    2\n    >>> prime_fib(2)\n    3\n    >>> prime_fib(3)\n    5\n    >>> prime_fib(4)\n    13\n    >>> prime_fib(5)\n    89\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    def prime_fib_is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    returns True if n is a prime number.\n    >>> prime_fib_is_prime(2)\n    True\n    >>> prime_fib_is_prime(6)\n    False\n    \"\"\"\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return True\n    return False", "def prime_fib(n: int):\n    \"\"\"\n    prime_fib returns n-th number that is a Fibonacci number and it's also prime.\n    >>> prime_fib(1)\n    2\n    >>> prime_fib(2)\n    3\n    >>> prime_fib(3)\n    5\n    >>> prime_fib(4)\n    13\n    >>> prime_fib(5)\n    89\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    def fib(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return fib(n-1)+fib(n-2)\n    return fib(n-1)+fib(n-2)\n    def fib(i):\n    if i == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return fib(i-1)+fib(i-2)\n    return fib(i-1)+fib(i-2)\n\nI think you need to modify the fib function so that it returns the value it's passed.\n\nAlso, I'm not sure that prime_fib returns the correct answer.\n\nThanks for the help!

(Note that in base 8, the first two numbers are 0 and 1, not 1 and 0 like in base 10.)\n\nI was also thinking about writing a version in base 8, but I got lazy.

Thanks for sharing.\n\nNice.\n\nIt would be nicer if it could generate the code in the article.\n\nAnyone know a good way to get the article's code onto a Mac?\n\nI think the best way is to do it on a Mac... I think the article is using Windows because it's likely the writer doesn't have a Mac.</s>", "def prime_fib(n: int):\n    \"\"\"\n    prime_fib returns n-th number that is a Fibonacci number and it's also prime.\n    >>> prime_fib(1)\n    2\n    >>> prime_fib(2)\n    3\n    >>> prime_fib(3)\n    5\n    >>> prime_fib(4)\n    13\n    >>> prime_fib(5)\n    89\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    prime = range(n)\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n         return prime % 2\n    else:\n         return prime", "def prime_fib(n: int):\n    \"\"\"\n    prime_fib returns n-th number that is a Fibonacci number and it's also prime.\n    >>> prime_fib(1)\n    2\n    >>> prime_fib(2)\n    3\n    >>> prime_fib(3)\n    5\n    >>> prime_fib(4)\n    13\n    >>> prime_fib(5)\n    89\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"", "def prime_fib(n: int):\n    \"\"\"\n    prime_fib returns n-th number that is a Fibonacci number and it's also prime.\n    >>> prime_fib(1)\n    2\n    >>> prime_fib(2)\n    3\n    >>> prime_fib(3)\n    5\n    >>> prime_fib(4)\n    13\n    >>> prime_fib(5)\n    89\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2) if n % 2 == 1 else fib(n-2) + fib(n-1)\n\nIsn't this a common issue in recursive functions?</s>", "def prime_fib(n: int):\n    \"\"\"\n    prime_fib returns n-th number that is a Fibonacci number and it's also prime.\n    >>> prime_fib(1)\n    2\n    >>> prime_fib(2)\n    3\n    >>> prime_fib(3)\n    5\n    >>> prime_fib(4)\n    13\n    >>> prime_fib(5)\n    89\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    def print_prime_fib(n: int):\n    \"\"\"\n    print a Fibonacci number and its prime.\n    >>> print_prime_fib(2)\n    3\n    >>> print_prime_fib(3)\n    5\n    \"\"\"\n    return n if n == 2 else n * 3 + n * 5\n\nfor k in xrange(2, 20):\n    print \"The k-th Fibonacci number is\", k, prime_fib(k)", "def prime_fib(n: int):\n    \"\"\"\n    prime_fib returns n-th number that is a Fibonacci number and it's also prime.\n    >>> prime_fib(1)\n    2\n    >>> prime_fib(2)\n    3\n    >>> prime_fib(3)\n    5\n    >>> prime_fib(4)\n    13\n    >>> prime_fib(5)\n    89\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    if n >= 2:\n        return n % 2\n    else:\n        return (n -

It's a very beautiful algorithm.\n\nI'm not seeing it. Why is it beautiful?\n\nWhat's beautiful in it is that you have a very simple algorithm that starts from 1, and works its way to prime numbers. The beauty is in the simplicity, not the underlying complexity.\n\n_The beauty is in the simplicity, not the underlying complexity._\nI disagree. One of the things that makes me appreciate the Fibonacci sequence is that it's a simple iterative process that produces an extremely complex shape. You can walk through the iterative process with your mind, and that's beautiful to me.\nI don't know how to describe it any better, but I don't see any beauty in this function. If it was called \"fibonacci_n\" I would expect it to return the n-th fibonacci number.\n\nI think you've hit on a subtle distinction.
