Then the next two are 5 and 8, then 13 and 21, then 34 and 55, then 89 and 144, etc.\nThe reason it works is that the first two numbers in the sequence are prime, so they can't be multiplied together to get a composite number. Therefore, the next two numbers are prime, and so on.\n\nIn other words, the first two numbers are prime because they're the only numbers that can't be expressed as the product of two smaller prime numbers.\n\nYes, that's the definition of a prime number.\n\nWhat is the definition of a prime number?", "def prime_fib(n: int):\n    \"\"\"\n    prime_fib returns n-th number that is a Fibonacci number and it's also prime.\n    >>> prime_fib(1)\n    2\n    >>> prime_fib(2)\n    3\n    >>> prime_fib(3)\n    5\n    >>> prime_fib(4)\n    13\n    >>> prime_fib(5)\n    89\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return [n if n % 2 == 1 else 1 for n in range(n)]", "def prime_fib(n: int):\n    \"\"\"\n    prime_fib returns n-th number that is a Fibonacci number and it's also prime.\n    >>> prime_fib(1)\n    2\n    >>> prime_fib(2)\n    3\n    >>> prime_fib(3)\n    5\n    >>> prime_fib(4)\n    13\n    >>> prime_fib(5)\n    89\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    if n <= 2:\n        return 0\n    if n == 2:\n        return 1\n    if n == 1:\n        return n\n    else:\n        return prime_fib(n-1) + prime_fib(n-2)", "def prime_fib(n: int):\n    \"\"\"\n    prime_fib returns n-th number that is a Fibonacci number and it's also prime.\n    >>> prime_fib(1)\n    2\n    >>> prime_fib(2)\n    3\n    >>> prime_fib(3)\n    5\n    >>> prime_fib(4)\n    13\n    >>> prime_fib(5)\n    89\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"", "def prime_fib(n: int):\n    \"\"\"\n    prime_fib returns n-th number that is a Fibonacci number and it's also prime.\n    >>> prime_fib(1)\n    2\n    >>> prime_fib(2)\n    3\n    >>> prime_fib(3)\n    5\n    >>> prime_fib(4)\n    13\n    >>> prime_fib(5)\n    89\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    n = 1\n    while n < n:\n        n = n * n\n    return n", "def prime_fib(n: int):\n    \"\"\"\n    prime_fib returns n-th number that is a Fibonacci number and it's also prime.\n    >>> prime_fib(1)\n    2\n    >>> prime_fib(2)\n    3\n    >>> prime_fib(3)\n    5\n    >>> prime_fib(4)\n    13\n    >>> prime_fib(5)\n    89\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"", "def prime_fib(n: int):\n    \"\"\"\n    prime_fib returns n-th number that is a Fibonacci number and it's also prime.\n    >>> prime_fib(1)\n    2\n    >>> prime_fib(2)\n    3\n    >>> prime_fib(3)\n    5\n    >>> prime_fib(4)\n    13\n    >>> prime_fib(5)\n    89\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    def fib(n: int):\n    \"\"\"\n    fib returns n-th number that is a Fibonacci number and it's also Fibonacci number.\n    >>> fib(1)\n    1\n    >>> fib(2)\n    1\n    >>> fib(3)\n    1\n    >>> fib(4)\n    1\n    \"\"\"\n    def fib_prime(n: int):\n    \"\"\"\n    fib_prime returns n-th number that is a Fibonacci number and it's also prime.\n    >>> fib_prime(1)\n    2\n    >>> fib_prime(2)\n    3\n    >>> fib_prime(3)\n    5\n    >>> fib_prime(4)\n    13\n    >>> fib_prime(5)\n    89\n    \"\"\"\n    def fib_prime_prime(n: int):\n    \"\"\"\n    fib", "def prime_fib(n: int):\n    \"\"\"\n    prime_fib returns n-th number that is a Fibonacci number and it's also prime.\n    >>> prime_fib(1)\n    2\n    >>> prime_fib(2)\n    3\n    >>> prime_fib(3)\n    5\n    >>> prime_fib(4)\n    13\n    >>> prime_fib(5)\n    89\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    def fib(n: int):\n    \"\"\"\n    fib returns n-th number that is a Fibonacci number.\n    >>> fib(1)\n    1\n    >>> fib(2)\n    1\n    >>> fib(3)\n    1\n    >>> fib(4)\n    1\n    >>> fib(5)\n    1\n    >>> fib(6)\n    1\n    >>> fib(7)\n    1\n    \"\"\"\n    def prime_fib(n: int):\n    \"\"\"\n    prime_fib returns n-th number that is a Fibonacci number and it's also prime.\n    >>> prime_fib(1)\n    2\n    >>> prime_fib(2)\n    3\n    >>> prime_fib(3)\n    5\n    >>> prime_fib(4)\n    13\n    >>> prime", "def prime_fib(n: int):\n    \"\"\"\n    prime_fib returns n-th number that is a Fibonacci number and it's also prime.\n    >>> prime_fib(1)\n    2\n    >>> prime_fib(2)\n    3\n    >>> prime_fib(3)\n    5\n    >>> prime_fib(4)\n    13\n    >>> prime_fib(5)\n    89\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return n % 2 == 0\n\nI don't think this is the best way to do this.

Why is the n in the return value?\n\nIt's a simple example of a \"return\" statement. The function is called prime_fib, so it returns the n-th prime Fibonacci number.\n\nI'm not sure I understand. I would think that a function like this would return a value. It looks like it is returning an expression.\n\nYou", "def prime_fib(n: int):\n    \"\"\"\n    prime_fib returns n-th number that is a Fibonacci number and it's also prime.\n    >>> prime_fib(1)\n    2\n    >>> prime_fib(2)\n    3\n    >>> prime_fib(3)\n    5\n    >>> prime_fib(4)\n    13\n    >>> prime_fib(5)\n    89\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    def fib(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    fib returns n-th number in Fibonacci sequence and it's also prime.\n    >>> fib(1)\n    1\n    >>> fib(2)\n    1\n    >>> fib(3)\n    1\n    >>> fib(4)\n    1\n    >>> fib(5)\n    1\n    \"\"\"\n    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)\n    def prime_fib(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    prime_fib returns n-th number that is a Fibonacci number and it's also prime.\n    >>> prime_fib(1)\n    2\n    >>> prime_fib(2)\n    3\n    >>> prime_fib(3)\n    5\n    >>> prime_fib(4)\n    13\n    >>> prime_fib(5)\n    89", "def prime_fib(n: int):\n    \"\"\"\n    prime_fib returns n-th number that is a Fibonacci number and it's also prime.\n    >>> prime_fib(1)\n    2\n    >>> prime_fib(2)\n    3\n    >>> prime_fib(3)\n    5\n    >>> prime_fib(4)\n    13\n    >>> prime_fib(5)\n    89\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"", "def prime_fib(n: int):\n    \"\"\"\n    prime_fib returns n-th number that is a Fibonacci number and it's also prime.\n    >>> prime_fib(1)\n    2\n    >>> prime_fib(2)\n    3\n    >>> prime_fib(3)\n    5\n    >>> prime_fib(4)\n    13\n    >>> prime_fib(5)\n    89\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n % 2 == 0\n    return n", "def prime_fib(n: int):\n    \"\"\"\n    prime_fib returns n-th number that is a Fibonacci number and it's also prime.\n    >>> prime_fib(1)\n    2\n    >>> prime_fib(2)\n    3\n    >>> prime_fib(3)\n    5\n    >>> prime_fib(4)\n    13\n    >>> prime_fib(5)\n    89\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    def fib(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    fib returns n-th number that is a Fibonacci number.\n    >>> fib(1)\n    1\n    >>> fib(2)\n    1\n    >>> fib(3)\n    1\n    >>> fib(4)\n    1\n    >>> fib(5)\n    2\n    \"\"\"\n    def prime_fib(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    prime_fib returns n-th number that is a Fibonacci number and it's also prime.\n    >>> prime_fib(1)\n    2\n    >>> prime_fib(2)\n    3\n    >>> prime_fib(3)\n    5\n    >>> prime_fib(4)\n    13\n    >>> prime_fib(5)\n    89\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:", "def prime_fib(n: int):\n    \"\"\"\n    prime_fib returns n-th number that is a Fibonacci number and it's also prime.\n    >>> prime_fib(1)\n    2\n    >>> prime_fib(2)\n    3\n    >>> prime_fib(3)\n    5\n    >>> prime_fib(4)\n    13\n    >>> prime_fib(5)\n    89\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"", "def prime_fib(n: int):\n    \"\"\"\n    prime_fib returns n-th number that is a Fibonacci number and it's also prime.\n    >>> prime_fib(1)\n    2\n    >>> prime_fib(2)\n    3\n    >>> prime_fib(3)\n    5\n    >>> prime_fib(4)\n    13\n    >>> prime_fib(5)\n    89\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    for i in range(1,n):\n       if n % i == 0:\n          return i\n    return 1\nI think you mean      return 1\n\nAlso, I think it's more likely to be called prime_fib(n)\n\nI did mean that.
