If you throw a person into the deep end with something like C++ they will likely give up and never learn to program.\n\nI disagree too.

I don't know how this is meant to be used, but if you want to parse an arbitrary string for palindromes, I would suggest using a regular expression.\n\nI had a quick look at regex palindrome matching and found that it's not trivial to do.\n\nI'm not sure that's the same.\n\nThe regular expression is not regular because it does not match itself. This is the crucial property of palindromes that does not work with regexes.\n\nI don't think that's the crucial property of palindromes. The crucial", "def is_palindrome(text: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if given string is a palindrome\n    >>> is_palindrome('')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('aba')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('aaaaa')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('zbcd')\n    False\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    if text == '':\n       return True\n    return False\n\nThat's nice and all, but how is that helpful? I get that it will work on a string, but how can this be used in a larger program? How can this help me write a larger program?\nI'm not trying to be snarky, I just want to know what kind of problem this can be applied to.\n\nAs a start, I use is_palindrome() to check if a list of words is a palindrome. If it's a palindrome, then I'm pretty sure that it's a sentence or something.\n\nI think this is also a good example of the usefulness of having a good debugger. Because of the way the test cases are set up (testing against the empty string, testing against a single letter, testing against 3 letters, etc), the error checking for this function is extremely easy to debug. A lot of times in my own code I forget to check all of the cases, and then I wind up with a subtle bug where I've tested a few corner cases, but there are still some cases that can cause a crash or unexpected result.", "def is_palindrome(text: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if given string is a palindrome\n    >>> is_palindrome('')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('aba')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('aaaaa')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('zbcd')\n    False\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return text[::-1] == text[::-1]\nThat should be `str[::-1]`; `text[::-1]` gives you the last character of the string, which will not be the same as the first character of the string.  Also, since `str` is not an object, but is instead a string literal, I don't think it would be acceptable to use the `[::-1]` notation.\nI think I'm going to write a small article about the \"little things\" Python programmers do that are dangerous, and make people believe Python is not a serious language.</s>", "def is_palindrome(text: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if given string is a palindrome\n    >>> is_palindrome('')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('aba')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('aaaaa')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('zbcd')\n    False\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return text[::-1] == text[::-1]\n\nI feel like there is a lot of simple-minded skepticism going on here. It's not clear to me why people would assume that if you don't do the same thing over and over and over again, you are not an engineer, or that you don't have a passion for technology, or that you are not even smart.\nI started programming when I was 8 years old, using C64 Basic. I was the only girl in my class, and I got teased a lot for it. I was an engineer before I knew what the word meant. I am an engineer because I am passionate about technology.\nThat being said, I think the author's post would be a lot more interesting if it were about the intersection of engineering and women rather than whether or not you have to be a boy to be an engineer.\n\nI understand how you feel, but I think the backlash is also justified. The definition of \"Engineer\" is pretty specific and the article is trying to extend it to include a lot of other jobs that don't fit the definition.\nBeing a programmer is just one of the many jobs that an engineer can be involved in.

I'm just too much of a beginner to be able to put any of it into practice.\n\nThat's probably one of the best \"for beginners\" python tutorials I've seen.\n\nYou should do a follow-up to this article with a section on Pandas. I know a lot of Python coders who will probably never be comfortable with the native library but who will be comfortable with Pandas.\n\nI don't use Pandas for my data analysis.

I understand why is_palindrome is called the most dangerous function in Python\nYou need to understand python to get that it does the same thing every time.  The string you pass in should be compared to the string returned, and if they match then the function should return True.\nI'm not sure I understand your comment - is it a joke, or are you criticizing me for writing a small example with a few lines of code?\nNo, I meant that the function will usually be used as a joke, like I did in my comment. It's not dangerous in any sense, so it's funny that it's called that.\nOh yeah, I've seen that a lot on here.   I was a bit confused by your comment, but I think I get it now.</s>", "def is_palindrome(text: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if given string is a palindrome\n    >>> is_palindrome('')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('aba')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('aaaaa')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('zbcd')\n    False\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n\n    # return true if the string is a palindrome\n    if isinstance(text, str):\n        return is_palindrome(text)\n    else:\n        return False\n   \n\nThere are many reasons why this is a bad idea, but the one that sticks out the most is the fact that str is a built-in type. Not only does it mean that the function is defined once in the standard library but also that any time you create a new string object you have to carry around this function's definition.\n\nThis is very bad for a number of reasons.\n\nThe first is that the function has to be defined in the standard library in order for this code to work. This makes writing extensions for the language much harder. For instance, consider the following code:\n\nimport math\nimport python\n\nfrom string import is_palindrome", "def is_palindrome(text: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if given string is a palindrome\n    >>> is_palindrome('')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('aba')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('aaaaa')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('zbcd')\n    False\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n\nIt was a hard decision between this and my_function_name_that_does_the_same_thing.\n\nYes.\nI'd also be inclined to call it \"is_paldrome\", to distinguish it from \"is_palindrome\", which is probably a function that validates palindromes.\n\nThis is one of the things I like about Python. Its preference for long, descriptive function names means that, by default, when you're looking at a piece of code, you have some idea what it does.\n\nThis is one of the things I hate about Python, when I'm working on someone else's code, and I can't remember what a function does, so I have to go through every line of every file until I find it.\nI think the two approaches to naming functions have a place - depending on what kind of work you're doing, I think either one could be better.\n\nCould you give some example situations where one approach is better than the other?\n\nIt's been said a thousand times, but this is one of the things I really, really like about Perl.

I had been thinking of how to do this in Python just this morning and was going to use a regular expression.\n\ni wrote a little script to convert english words to palindromes the other day. it was very cool, but very inefficient: it converted an english word to a palindrome by converting it to a number and then using a lookup table of numbers in the form of the english word.\n\nWould you be interested in making it more efficient and open sourcing it?\n\nthat's a good idea. i'd be interested. i'm a little busy with my startup right now, so it might take a while, but i'll try to do it this weekend.", "def is_palindrome(text: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if given string is a palindrome\n    >>> is_palindrome('')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('aba')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('aaaaa')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('zbcd')\n    False\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    if text == '':\n        return True\n    else:\n        return text[:-1] == text[:-1]\n\nThe code is very simple, but what if we want to check if something is a palindrome in many languages at once?\n\nFor example, we want to check if something is a palindrome in Spanish, English, and French.\n\nWe can use the solution described by the article but the code will be a bit more complex.\n\nfrom collections import Counter", "def is_palindrome(text: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if given string is a palindrome\n    >>> is_palindrome('')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('aba')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('aaaaa')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('zbcd')\n    False\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return text.find(r'^\\\\w+\\\\s*$').startswith('^') and text.endswith('^') and text.find(r'^\\\\w+$').endswith('$')\nWhat's the point of using Python if you're going to write such terrible code?\n\nI'm using a language that I'm familiar with, and its a little program that checks if a string is a palindrome.

Thanks for the catch.\n\nMaybe if you are not using Python you should mention this in the first place :)\n\nI don't know any programming language that doesn't have the same property.\n\nR has a special type of string called a character vector, and it can contain multiple \"a\"'s.\n\nIt's kind of interesting to see how many people don't realize that you don't need to keep track of the index of the first character.\n\nI think it's because of the way we were", "def is_palindrome(text: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if given string is a palindrome\n    >>> is_palindrome('')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('aba')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('aaaaa')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('zbcd')\n    False\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return text == text[::-1]\n\nThe problem here is that the author only checks that the second character is the same in both sides, when the last character in a palindrome is the same. So the second character in \"abc\" is the same as the second character in \"abc\", but the last character is different. So it fails.\n\nIt's probably faster to just check if you're dealing with one of these \"shorter\" palindromes:\n\na  aa  aa  aa  aaa  ab  abc\n\nThese are all palindromes.\n\nAnd they all have one particular property: They're also totally symmetric in length. That means you can do a binary search with the first character, since it can be either the left or the rightmost character.\n\nYou can also do a bit more in this test, like checking that you don't start with the same word or something like that.\n\nI can't tell if you're serious or not.\n\nThis is a simple logic puzzle.

For example, the string 'aaba' is a palindrome, but the string 'bbbb' is not.\n\nThis is true, but there's no reason to allow the case of a character repeated twice, since the ASCII characters don't repeat (aside from the null character).\n\nBut there is a reason to allow case of repeated letters.\n\nI wonder if I can implement it as a utility in python...\n\nNot all strings are palindromes.\n\nI thought it was a bit of a trick question, I guess it's a good measure of how much I know of python.</s>", "def is_palindrome(text: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if given string is a palindrome\n    >>> is_palindrome('')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('aba')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('aaaaa')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('zbcd')\n    False\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return text == text.lstrip('.')\nI don't get it.

When you define a function, the only arguments you have to give it are the name, and the body of the function. If you don't define any arguments, Python will fill in the positional arguments.\nSo, to define is_palindrome(), he just put it in a module, and in the module, he defined a function is_palindrome, that takes no arguments.\n\nI understand that much, but I don't understand how that works. Does the builtin function __builtin__.is_palindrome() actually look up the function in the module? Or is it some other magic?\n\nI'm pretty sure it's a bit more complicated than that. It's been a while since I was last using Python, but I know that the __repr__() function works by essentially looking up the method definition in the current namespace, and returning the string for that method.
