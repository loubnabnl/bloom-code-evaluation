It's not supposed to check if a string is a palindrome, it's supposed to check if a given string is a palindrome.\n\nIt's a common enough question to have a function to do it though.\n\nI think there is a common misunderstanding that the purpose of this function is to check if a given string is a palindrome.\n\nThat's a good point, but I'm not sure it's a common enough misunderstanding to justify a comment on a blog post.\n\nI have to say, I've never had a problem with this in Python, but I've seen it enough times in C and C++ to know that it's a common enough problem.\n\nThis is a great post, and I think it's a good example of a good \"blog post\". It's short and to the point, but still gives you something to think about.\n\nI think the biggest problem with this code is that it's not in a module.\n\nI disagree.

It is a very slow way to do it, and it is not very robust. It is also very fragile.\nA better way to do it is to use a dictionary. You can just hash the string and check for equality.\n\nPython's built-in `re` module implements a very fast regular expression matcher. I don't know if it's as fast as the C version, but it's still pretty fast.\n\nYou are right, I was thinking about the C version.\n\nThe C version is pretty fast, but it is also fragile. It is easy to mess it up. It is also a bad idea to use it for anything other than simple regexps.\n\nI'd say it's pretty easy to mess up a dictionary hash of a string too.\n\nI would disagree. A dictionary is just a hash map, which is a very simple data structure. It is very hard to mess up.\n\nIt's not a hash map.

It was not to make a perfect string utility.\n\nI agree with the author's point that a lot of the time, you really don't need to reinvent the wheel.\nBut in the case of string utilities, I think there's a valid argument to be made that you should.\nString utilities are often used in many places throughout an application. I've seen it happen that if you don't write your own string utilities, you end up with a mess of string utilities that all do the same thing, and each one of them has some subtle difference that makes it a little bit different from the others.\nIf you write your own string utilities, then you can make sure that they all do the same thing. You can also make sure that they all do the same thing the same way.\nI think it's more important that your string utilities all do the same thing the same way", "def is_palindrome(text: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if given string is a palindrome\n    >>> is_palindrome('')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('aba')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('aaaaa')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('zbcd')\n    False\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return text == text\nI don't get it.\n\nYou don't get it? What don't you get?\n\nI don't get the point of the function. I would have expected a function called is_palindrome to return true if the string is a palindrome, and false otherwise.\n\nThat's exactly what the function does.\n\nI see. I was reading the code too literally. I thought the function was returning True if the string was a palindrome, and False otherwise. I see now that it is returning True if the string is a palindrome, and False otherwise.\n\nI think this is a great example of how a simple, clear and well-named function can be much more readable than a one-liner.\n\nI can't tell if you're being sarcastic or not.\n\nI'm not.\n\nThis is a pretty trivial example. A more interesting one would be a function that takes an arbitrary number of arguments and returns True if all the arguments are palindromes.\n\nThe problem with that is that you need to know the number of arguments. You could use a dictionary with all the possible palindromes as keys and the number", "def is_palindrome(text: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if given string is a palindrome\n    >>> is_palindrome('')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('aba')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('aaaaa')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('zbcd')\n    False\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    def is_palindrome(text: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if given string is a palindrome\n    >>> is_palindrome('aaaaaa')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('aaaaa')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('aaaaaaaa')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('aaaaaaaaaa')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa')", "def is_palindrome(text: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if given string is a palindrome\n    >>> is_palindrome('')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('aba')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('aaaaa')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('zbcd')\n    False\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    if not text.isdigit():\n       return False\n    return text == text.replace('a', 'b')\nI'm not sure why you are using is_digit, that is not part of the definition of a palindrome.\n\nI guess the point is that this is not a very useful way to check for palindromes.</s>", "def is_palindrome(text: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if given string is a palindrome\n    >>> is_palindrome('')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('aba')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('aaaaa')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('zbcd')\n    False\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return text == text[::-1]\n\nThe only problem is that it doesn't handle non-english characters.\n\nI've just implemented this in Python:", "def is_palindrome(text: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if given string is a palindrome\n    >>> is_palindrome('')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('aba')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('aaaaa')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('zbcd')\n    False\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    # Using the \"if\" statement to see if the first character is a vowel\n    if text[0] == 'a':\n        return True\n    # Using the \"if\" statement to see if the last character is a vowel\n    if text[len(text)-1] == 'a':\n        return True\n    # Using the \"if\" statement to see if the whole string is a vowel\n    if text[len(text) - 1] == 'a':\n        return True\n    # Using the \"if\" statement to see if the whole string is a consonant\n    if text[len(text) - 1] == 'a':\n        return True\n    # Using the \"if\" statement to see if the whole string is a vowel\n    if text[len(text) - 1] == 'a':\n        return True\n    return False", "def is_palindrome(text: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if given string is a palindrome\n    >>> is_palindrome('')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('aba')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('aaaaa')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('zbcd')\n    False\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return text == text[:-1]\nI'm not sure if I should downvote for being a joke answer or upvote for being clever...\nI think it's a bit of both.</s>", "def is_palindrome(text: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if given string is a palindrome\n    >>> is_palindrome('')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('aba')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('aaaaa')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('zbcd')\n    False\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    def __str__(self):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a string representation of this object\n    >>> print(is_palindrome('aaaaa'))\n    'aaaaa'\n    >>> print(is_palindrome('zbbb'))\n    'zbbb'\n    \"\"\"\n    return '%s is a palindrome' % self.__class__.__name__", "def is_palindrome(text: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if given string is a palindrome\n    >>> is_palindrome('')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('aba')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('aaaaa')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('zbcd')\n    False\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return text == text\nI don't see what's wrong with this.\n\nYour palindrome function is a boolean.\n\nI think the problem is that \"==\" is not defined for strings, but that's not the function's fault.\n\nIt's not the function's fault, but it _is_ the function's problem.

It fails on \"abcd\", \"abcd\", \"abcd\", \"abcd\" and \"abcd\".\n\nWhat's the better check?\n\nI was thinking about it a bit, and I think the best way to do it is to split the string into two parts: a prefix and a suffix. Then you check that the prefix is a palindrome, and the suffix is a palindrome.
