You get the benefit of the list's sorted ordering, and the list's size is much smaller than the collection, since the list is a copy of the collection minus the first element.\n\nPython is a lot like Java in this regard, except you have to be a bit more careful about the types.\n\nI'd be careful about saying this is a \"good\" idiom in Java - especially if you are", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.\n    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.\n    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])\n    [1, 3, 4]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    dups = {}\n    for i in xrange(numbers.length):\n        dups[numbers[i]] = numbers[i]\n    return dups\n\nDo you know how to write that in python 2?\n\nTo me, this is the important question.\n\nAs far as I can tell, the feature isn't available in Python 2.x.\n\n<python-2.6.3>\n>>> x = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5]\n>>> x[0]\n1\n>>> x.remove_duplicates()\n[1, 3, 4]\n\nI meant the new keyword.\n\nYou can always use the C API.\n\nWhich you will need to compile on OS X.\n\nNot necessarily.

I just wish Python had some way of autocompleting it.\n\nfrom typing import List", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.\n    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.\n    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])\n    [1, 3, 4]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return numbers.remove(numbers.remove(numbers.pop()))\n\nThere's a lot to like about this; it's short, expressive, readable, and there are no side-effects.\nHowever, I don't think it will work as advertised on a list of integers. If you pass it a list of integers, and you call remove_duplicates with that list, you will get an empty list back. That's because lists are built using integer indexes; the first element of the list is at index 0. This means that numbers.remove(numbers.pop()) is removing elements from the _front_ of the list, but there aren't any in the front because the first element is at index 0.\nI think it would work if you implemented it like this:", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.\n    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.\n    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])\n    [1, 3, 4]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    numbers.remove(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.index(numbers.", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.\n    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.\n    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])\n    [1, 3, 4]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.\n    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.\n    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])\n    [1, 3, 4]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    for n in numbers:\n        if n in numbers:\n            continue\n                return numbers\n\nI didn't understand the need for this. Can you explain why it is useful?\n\nI think it's just an exercise in Python, not a practical use.\n\nIt is probably just an exercise. I think this kind of list is what you get when you use a list comprehension to do a function call:\n[function(x) for x in xs if x not in xs]\n[function(x) for x in xs if len(xs)!= 1]\n[function(x) for x in xs if x is not None]\n[function(x) for x in xs if x < 10]\n\nI don't know about this particular example, but generally, list comprehensions are incredibly useful. You can do some really neat stuff with them, like:\nfor i in [1,2,3,4,5]:", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.\n    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.\n    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])\n    [1, 3, 4]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    for i in range(1, n):\n       if numbers[i]!= numbers[i + 1]:\n          numbers[i] = numbers[i + 1]\n       else:\n           raise ValueError(\"duplicate numbers found\")\n    return numbers", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.\n    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.\n    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])\n    [1, 3, 4]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    numbers = numbers.filter(lambda x: x.is_number()).reverse()\n    return numbers\n\nI'd much rather do this:", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.\n    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.\n    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])\n    [1, 3, 4]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.\n    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.\n    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])\n    [1, 3, 4]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    for i in numbers:\n        if i == number:\n            continue\n        if len(numbers) == 1:\n              return numbers\n              return numbers[::-1]\n\nfrom typing import List", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.\n    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.\n    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])\n    [1, 3, 4]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    for number in numbers:\n        if number not in numbers:\n           return numbers\n        else:\n            number, number2 = numbers.get(0), numbers.get(numbers.size() - 1)\n            if number2 not in numbers:\n               return numbers\n           else:\n                numbers.remove(number)\n          return numbers\n\nThere's a bit of a trick in there. If you want to see it, you need to examine how remove_duplicates(numbers, [0]) behaves (which is the same as [numbers.get(0)].pop()).\n\nFor those who don't see it, it looks like this:\n\nnumbers = [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]\n\nnumbers.pop()", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.\n    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.\n    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])\n    [1, 3, 4]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    for i in numbers:\n       if i not in numbers:\n          numbers.remove(i)\n    return numbers\n\nThat's not a function. It's a procedure.\nA function is a declarative object that can be passed around and returned from functions. Procedures can only be called and return nothing (a boolean, in this case).\n\nProcedures _can_ return values.\n\nI'm aware of that, but that's not what I meant.\nWhat I meant is that a procedure can be called but it can't be passed around and it can't be returned.\nIn this case, \"remove_duplicates\" doesn't return anything, so it's just a procedure.\n\nThis example is a bit misleading because List objects are not a built in Python data structure. They are created using the List() function and you do not have to type \"from typing import List\" in order to use them.\n\nI agree. I was also thrown by the example. At first I was wondering why it wasn't a dictionary, which is the typical choice for such an exercise.

The correct one is the top voted comment, but your version is much more succinct, so I've upvoted it.\n\nIt is not more succinct. The shorter version has the bug that if the list contains a duplicate of the item being removed then it will not be removed.\n\nI think that is a bug in the python list implementation.

It only removes the items from the input list that occur more than once.\nA list is like a hashmap in Python. It's a collection of items with a specific type (in this case, integer).\nIn Java, the list is created with a for loop and some code to sort the items.\nThe remove_duplicates method does the filtering for you.

A list comprehension can be written in any order, which is good if you need to do it several times in a row, but bad if you don't. It's also more difficult to understand what it's doing.\nI think the most important reason why this is a bad solution is that it won't work for non-deterministic data. A list of integers, for example, can be generated by multiple processes (even within the same program), and so the order of elements will be different in each case. The list comprehension solution will have no way to decide which of the duplicate items to remove.\n\nI didn't even think about that.

It has methods.\nmethods are defined in the class definition.\nso, remove_duplicates is a method in the List class.\nTo call a method, you do something like:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4]\nnumbers.remove_duplicates()\nThe above code will not work, because list is a type, not a class,\nso it has no methods.\nTo call a method in a type (or a tuple, or a class, or a module)", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.\n    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.\n    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])\n    [1, 3, 4]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    def remove_duplicates_keep_order(numbers: List[int]):\n    \"\"\" Remove duplicates from a list of integers, and keep the order of\n    the remaining elements the same.\n    >>> remove_duplicates_keep_order([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])\n    [1, 3, 4]\n    \"\"\"\n    a = numbers[1:]\n    # Get first duplicate\n    while a!= numbers[-1:] or a!= numbers[numbers.length-1]:\n       a = numbers[-1:]\n       numbers.remove(a)\n    return numbers\n\nHow is this different from:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4]\nnumbers.remove_duplicates([0])\n\nI don't think it's possible to do that with a list.\n\nYou can use map instead of list.\n\nWhat I learned from this code: you can use \"from\" to import a module.

I expected a compiler error.\n\nWhy would you expect a compiler error? The code does exactly what the comment says it does.\n\nI'm not familiar with Python, but is it possible to define a list as a function? For example, say I want to make a list of squares:\nsquare = lambda x: x * x\nsquare(4)\nThis would make square a function that returns a list. Is it possible to do something similar in Python?\n\nYes, it's called a generator function:\n\nThat's really slick, though it seems like there are a lot of opportunities for error when using this approach.\n\nWhy?", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.\n    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.\n    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])\n    [1, 3, 4]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    def remove_duplicates_by_count(numbers: List[int], count: int):\n    \"\"\" Removes all elements from a list that occur more than count times.\n    >>> remove_duplicates_by_count([1, 2, 3, 2, 4], 3)\n    [1, 3, 4]\n    \"\"\"", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.\n    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.\n    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])\n    [1, 3, 4]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n\nDon't get me wrong - I love Python, but I hate these kind of \"magic\" solutions.\n\nI prefer this:\nfrom typing import List\nnumbers = [1,2,3,2,4]\nnumbers_without_duplicates = [1,3,4]\n\nI'm not sure why you are getting downvoted. You are absolutely correct. The real \"magic\" solution is to use the \"magic\" of the language to write the code for you.\n\nI suppose people here think I'm criticizing Python. I'm not, I love Python. I just think it's a good idea to do things like this by hand and understand the algorithm, instead of using the language to do it for you.\n\nIs this just a joke? What the hell is this doing on the front page of HN?\n\nMany, many people find the Python interpreter useful and/or interesting.\n\nI know that. I am a Python developer. I just can't see how anyone would find this funny or interesting.\n\nIt's about how much of a joke the type system is in Python. In most languages the addition of an import would cause the compiler to notice the error", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.\n    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.\n    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])\n    [1, 3, 4]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    for i in range(numbers.size)\n        if numbers[i] == numbers[i+1]:\n            remove_duplicates(numbers[i+1])\n    return numbers\n\nEfficient? Really? Not so much.\n\nThis code might not be very fast, but it's efficient. (I would argue that it's not even not very fast, but that's a different topic.)\n\nI guess you're talking about that P vs NP paper. For an unsorted list of 1 million integers, remove_duplicates() is O(n) time. In other words, the time to process 1 million integers is linear in the number of integers.\n\nBut you can't just assume that the input is unsorted, can you? If you did, the code would be inefficient.\n\nTrue, but I don't think anyone is going to be loading a million integers into memory to process them with this function.</s>", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.\n    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.\n    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])\n    [1, 3, 4]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    numbers = [x for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0]\n\n    return numbers", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.\n    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.\n    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])\n    [1, 3, 4]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    for i in xrange(0, len(numbers)) + 1:\n        if numbers[i] in numbers:\n           numbers[i] = numbers[i]\n    return numbers</s>", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.\n    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.\n    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])\n    [1, 3, 4]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    for n in numbers:\n       if n not in numbers:\n          numbers.remove(n)\n          numbers.remove(n)\n    return numbers\n\nThis is similar to a Common Lisp idiom:\n(filter (* 2) (list 1 2 3 4)) => (2 1 4 3)\nYou can also use it to remove duplicate elements from a sequence using a lambda function:\n(map (lambda (x) (not x)) [(1 2 3 4) (5 6 7 8)] => [(1 5 7 9) (2 6 8 10)]\n\nIn perl\nmy @dups = qw[1 2 3];\nwhile (my ($first, $last) = each %$dups) {", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.\n    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.\n    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])\n    [1, 3, 4]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    for number in numbers:\n       if number in numbers:\n           return numbers\n    else:\n           remove_duplicates(number)\n    return numbers\n\nwhile not as elegant it should work:\nimport re\nnumbers = re.findall('[0-9]', numbers)\nnumbers.sort()\n\n\"from typing import List\"\nNice.\n\nFrom the article: \"In the code above, I am using a Python module called typing, which allows you to write Python code that will compile to Python bytecode.\"\n\n\"In the code above, I am using a Python module called typing, which allows you to write Python code that will compile to Python bytecode.\"\nYou're right.

If you want to do something similar to this, you could write a function that applies list comprehensions to a range of numbers, in effect filtering out duplicates before generating a list.\n\nI think I understand what the author is trying to say. The problem is that beginners often find the list comprehensions \"magical\" and that leads them", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.\n    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.\n    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])\n    [1, 3, 4]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    for i in numbers:\n       if numbers[i] in numbers:\n           return numbers\n    return List()\n\nimport remove_duplicates\n\n    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 5, 1, 4, 4, 5, 5]\n    print remove_duplicates(numbers)\n    print numbers\n\nThis is the classic demo of why duck typing is not sufficient for a language. This function would never typecheck, and would cause errors at runtime.\n\nWhat if this was written in python?", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.\n    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.\n    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])\n    [1, 3, 4]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    numbers = (numbers.filter(n => n % 2 == 0)).sum()\n    return numbers.remove(0)\n\nThis is actually quite useful. I've used something similar in the past to find the largest number that doesn't repeat.\n\nyes, and you can also write it in a more general way:\nfrom collections import defaultdict", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.\n    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.\n    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])\n    [1, 3, 4]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    for i in numbers:\n       if number[i]!= number[i+1]:\n          numbers.remove(i)\n    return numbers</s>", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.\n    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.\n    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])\n    [1, 3, 4]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n           return numbers.filter(n > 1)\n\nfrom typing import *\n\n    def sum(numbers: List[int]) -> int:\n    \"\"\" From a list of integers, sum the elements.\n    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.\n    >>> sum([1, 2, 3, 4])\n    10 \"\"\"\n          return numbers.reduce(0, +)\n\nfrom typing import *\n\n    def average(numbers: List[int]) -> int:\n    \"\"\" From a list of integers, calculate the average of the elements.\n    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.\n    >>> average([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n    4.0 \"\"\"\n          return numbers.reduce(0, +) / len(numbers)\n\nfrom typing import *\n\n    def min(numbers: List[int]) -> int:\n    \"\"\" From a list of integers", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.\n    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.\n    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])\n    [1, 3, 4]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    for i in numbers:\n       if i not in numbers:\n          return numbers\n    return List(i + 1)\n\nI think a better approach is to use a dictionary:\n>>> d = {}\n>>> d[0] = 1\n>>> d[1] = 2\n>>> d[2] = 3\n>>> d[3] = 2\n>>> d[4] = 4\n>>> d[4] = 3\n>>> d[3] = 2\n>>> d[4] = 4\n>>> d[4] = 3\n>>> d[3] = 2\n>>> d[4] = 4\n>>> d[3] = 2\n>>> d[4] = 4\n>>> d[3] = 2\n>>> d[4] = 4\n>>> d[3] = 2\n>>> d[4] = 4\n>>> d[3] = 2\n>>> d[4] = 4\n>>> d[3] = 2\n>>> d[4] = 4\n>>> d[3] = 2\n>>> d[4] = 4\n>>> d[3] = 2", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.\n    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.\n    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])\n    [1, 3, 4]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n\n    return numbers.filter(x: x == number for x, number in zip(x, numbers))\n\n    def array_of_int(a: List[int]):\n    \"\"\" Return a list of integers, in the order of their appearance in the original list.\n    >>> array_of_int([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    >>> array_of_int([2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])\n    [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n    >>> array_of_int([3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 2])\n    [2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 2]\n    \"\"\"\n\n    return a.sort()\n\nThis is a toy example, but I see this kind of thing all the time in Java code. What's wrong with:", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.\n    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.\n    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])\n    [1, 3, 4]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return numbers"]]
