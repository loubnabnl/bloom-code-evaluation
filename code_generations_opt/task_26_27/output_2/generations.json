If you're sorting a list of objects, use the built-in sorted() method.\n\nThis is a nice trick, but it's only useful if you're using Python 2.4 or earlier.

This is useful only if you have a specific need to remove duplicates.\n\nWhat if you have a list of numbers in which you want to remove all duplicate elements, but also preserve the order of the remaining elements?\n\nIt's a bad idea to remove all duplicates, in general. It's a good idea to remove duplicates if you need to for some reason.\n\nIs it a bad idea to remove all duplicates if you know that the list is already sorted?\n\nYes. In the common case, it's a waste of time and memory.\n\nI don't know if I agree. The common case is that you have a list of numbers and you want to remove all duplicate elements. If the list is already sorted, then removing all duplicates is a simple way to remove all duplicate elements.\n\nThe common case is that you have", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.\n    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.\n    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])\n    [1, 3, 4]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" Remove all elements in the list that occur more than once.\n    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])\n    [1, 3, 4]\n    \"\"\"\n    def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" Remove all elements in the list that occur more than once.\n    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])\n    [1, 3, 4]\n    \"\"\"\n    def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" Remove all elements in the list that occur more than once.\n    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])\n    [1, 3, 4]\n    \"\"\"\n    def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.\n    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.\n    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])\n    [1, 3, 4]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    numbers = numbers.sort()\n    for i in range(len(numbers)):\n        if numbers[i]!= numbers[i+1]:\n           numbers.remove(i)\n    return numbers\n\nYou forgot the import :)</s>", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.\n    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.\n    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])\n    [1, 3, 4]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    for i in numbers:\n        if i not in numbers:\n            numbers.remove(i)\n             numbers.append(i)\n    return numbers\n\nThis is a good example of how to write a function that does one thing and does it well.\n\n_This is a good example of how to write a function that does one thing and does it well._\nI think you're thinking of:", "from typing import List\n\n\ndef remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.\n    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.\n    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])\n    [1, 3, 4]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    numbers.sort()\n    for number in numbers:\n       if number in numbers:\n          raise ValueError(\"Duplicate number %r in input list\" % number)\n          numbers.remove(number)\n\nThat's a good example of why I prefer Python's \"from __future__ import...\" syntax.\n\nIt's not clear to me why that syntax is preferable.\nThe import syntax is a bit verbose, but it's pretty clear what it's doing, and it's also clear what the code does.\nThe __future__ import syntax is a bit less verbose, but it's not clear what it does, and it's not clear what the code does.\n\nIt's not clear to you what it does because you already know what it does. It's a bit of syntactic sugar that imports a module without having to explicitly call the function that imports the module.\n\nThis is the correct answer.

Do you mean the first element in a list is always the smallest?\n\nNo, that's not what I mean.\nI mean a list of integers where the first element is the smallest and the second element is the second smallest, and so on.\n\nAnd that's what he meant, too.\n\nIf I'm not mistaken, the most common natural order for a list of integers is the order in which they are entered. This is true for all the lists I've encountered.\n\nThat is the natural order for lists of integers.

In fact, I think it's a terrible example. It's not a good introduction to programming, because it doesn't show you how to do anything interesting.\n\nI think it's a great example. It's simple, it's elegant, and it demonstrates the way that Python handles lists.\n\nIt's a great example of how Python handles lists. But, as an introduction to programming, it's not very helpful.\n\nThe first time I read this, I was a bit confused.
