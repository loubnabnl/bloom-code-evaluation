What is being tested is if n can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers. Since n is 0 for any non-negative n, we can immediately discard the first test. Then, you get the sum of the digits of n, which will either be an even number, or even number and a zero. If it is an even number, we can throw away the second test. Finally, if the sum of the digits is even, we can discard the third test, and we have our result.\n\nThe above example is a bit contrived, since the number is just 1 less than a power of 2.

He's taking advantage of the fact that most people, when asked to write a program that takes n, checks to see if n is even or odd. Then checks whether n is the sum of 4 even numbers.\nBut in python, you don't need a list comprehension to write the is_even function. And even if you did, you could just look at the list itself to see if it's the sum of 4 even numbers.\n\n_In Python, \"is_equal_to_sum_even\" is a function._\nSo? It's a function that's supposed to give you a function. You can't make it a function without using a list comprehension.\n\nWhy do you need to make it a function? That's the odd bit here.\n\n... which is why you can't make it a function without a list comprehension.\n\nI'm not convinced. What is the function supposed to be?\n\nTo be clear, this is a silly example.

It's a one-liner that's using a clever trick to get the answer without doing lots of checks for divisibility by 4.\n\nSince you're going to be doing a lot of arithmetic, the trick is to make sure you use the right kind of arithmetic. In this case, the trick is to define a function called is_equal_to_sum_even and use it in a Python list comprehension.
