In Python, the sum and product of a list of integers is defined in terms of the __add__ and __mul__ built-in functions.\n3\\. The sum and product of a list of integers is not a very common operation. It's very easy to write a function that does it.\n4\\. The function written by the author doesn't do the right thing for all possible inputs. For example, the author's function will raise an error if the list is empty.\n5\\. The author's function doesn't do the right thing for all possible inputs because the author's function is not a function at all. It's a class, and it's a class that requires a bunch of boilerplate code to define.\n6\\.

It's the same thing, just more verbose.\n\nI think the parent was referring to the fact that the tuple is passed by reference, and the result is a copy.\n\nIf you're passing a tuple by reference, you're doing it wrong.\n\nTuple is immutable, so you can't pass it by value.\n\nYes, you can, just not a tuple of immutable values.\n\nThat's not what immutable means.\n\nI think he meant that you can pass a mutable tuple by value, but only if all of its elements are mutable.\n\nThat's what I meant. Thanks.\n\nI think it's a good exercise to convert this to a function (e.g. sum_product_f). Then you can use it in your code without having to worry about what types are involved.\n\nI disagree.

The real world examples are much more complicated, and usually involve a lot of repetition.\n\nI would be interested in seeing some examples of real world problems that you think this would be useful for.\n\nOne of the things I do at work is use a dictionary to store all the possible values of a boolean, and then use a list comprehension to get the value I want.\nHere's an example:\nfrom typing import List, Tuple", "from typing import List, Tuple\n\n\ndef sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:\n    \"\"\" For a given list of integers, return a tuple consisting of a sum and a product of all the integers in a list.\n    Empty sum should be equal to 0 and empty product should be equal to 1.\n    >>> sum_product([])\n    (0, 1)\n    >>> sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4])\n    (10, 24)\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    n = len(numbers)\n    for i in numbers:\n       sum = 0\n       product = 1\n    return (sum, product)\n\nThis is a nice little demonstration of list comprehensions, but it's not a very good example of what I'd call \"Pythonic\" code.\nThe first thing that jumps out at me is that there's no import of the builtin function sum(). This is a good example of the \"excessive use of builtin functions\" that I've seen people complain about when criticizing Python.\nThe second thing that jumps out is the use of the list comprehension syntax. There's nothing wrong with that, but it's not a common idiom. The sum_product function is a nice example of a function that lends itself well to list comprehensions, but I don't think I've ever seen a list comprehension that was more than a couple of lines long.\nThe third thing that jumps out is the use of tuples. Tuple unpacking is a useful idiom, but it's not as common as the Python FAQ would have you believe.\nFinally, the function is not very readable.

Tuples are a type, and lists are a type. You can use tuples to replace lists in the same way that you can use ints to replace floats.\n\nYes, you can. Tuples are more compact than lists, and they're faster to iterate over.\n\nI think you're confusing \"use case\" with \"implementation detail\".\n\nYou're right.

It's trivial to implement sum_product() in Python using tuples, but it's much harder to do it with lists.\nI'd like to see the same example but with a list of dictionaries.\n\nYou can't do this with tuples either.\n\nI don't think that's true. You can use tuples to represent any ordered list.\n\nI think you're missing the point. The code snippet is intended to illustrate a situation where a list comprehension is not suitable.

The lambda is very concise and clear, but it's also very _unpythonic_.\n\nIt's not unpythonic, it's just a different style of writing.\n\nI think that the only reason it's unpythonic is that Python doesn't have a good way to define a function that takes a lambda as an argument.\n\nA function that takes a lambda as an argument is a lambda function.\n\nYes, but if you want to do anything with the lambda, you need to create a local variable.\n\nI'm not sure what you mean by \"do anything with the lambda\".\n\nI mean that if you want to do something with the result of the lambda, you need to create", "from typing import List, Tuple\n\n\ndef sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:\n    \"\"\" For a given list of integers, return a tuple consisting of a sum and a product of all the integers in a list.\n    Empty sum should be equal to 0 and empty product should be equal to 1.\n    >>> sum_product([])\n    (0, 1)\n    >>> sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4])\n    (10, 24)\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    sum = 0\n    product = 0\n    for i in numbers:\n        sum += i\n        product += (sum * i)\n    return sum, product\n\nI would prefer the following:"]]
