You can omit the return:\nsum_to_n(n):\nn+n\n\nThat's nice, but I don't think that works with the `lambda` syntax, right?\n\nYou are correct.

But can you provide a quick explanation?\n\nYou have to use the new lambda syntax if you want to pass multiple arguments to a function.\n\nSo you're saying the new lambda syntax is only in python 2.7? I can't do this in 2.6?\n\nYes. Python 2.7 is the current version, 2.6 is the older one. 2.7 also has some other nice things in it (decimal literals, named arguments, etc).</s>", "def sum_to_n(n: int):\n    \"\"\"sum_to_n is a function that sums numbers from 1 to n.\n    >>> sum_to_n(30)\n    465\n    >>> sum_to_n(100)\n    5050\n    >>> sum_to_n(5)\n    15\n    >>> sum_to_n(10)\n    55\n    >>> sum_to_n(1)\n    1\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    def sum_to_n(n: int):\n    \"\"\" sum_to_n is a function that sums numbers from 1 to n.\n    >>> sum_to_n(30)\n    465\n    >>> sum_to_n(100)\n    5050\n    >>> sum_to_n(5)\n    15\n    >>> sum_to_n(10)\n    55\n    >>> sum_to_n(1)\n    1\n    \"\"\"\n    pass\n    def sum_to_n(n: int):\n    \"\"\" sum_to_n is a function that sums numbers from 1 to n.\n    >>> sum_to_n(30)\n    465\n    >>> sum_to_n(100)\n    5050\n    >>> sum_to_n(5)\n    15\n    >>> sum_to_n(10)\n    55\n    >>> sum_to_n", "def sum_to_n(n: int):\n    \"\"\"sum_to_n is a function that sums numbers from 1 to n.\n    >>> sum_to_n(30)\n    465\n    >>> sum_to_n(100)\n    5050\n    >>> sum_to_n(5)\n    15\n    >>> sum_to_n(10)\n    55\n    >>> sum_to_n(1)\n    1\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return sum(1,1) + sum(2,1) + sum(3,1) +... + sum(n,1)\n\nOne of the problems with this approach is that it's not in Python's 'idiomatic' style.\n\nThat isn't a problem.\n\nThe only thing I'd say is that if you want to learn Python, using Python's idiomatic style is definitely the way to go.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause you'll get a better grasp on the language.\n\nIs this really true? I've seen a lot of code written by Python 'experts' that I think is a lot more convoluted and difficult to understand than my own code.\n\nYup. That's why python has a ton of \"try and don't fail\" idioms.\n\nI don't think that's a good example. You might argue that it's more \"idiomatic\" to use the Python 'itertools' module, which is documented here:\nHowever, you'd then be ignoring the many other useful functions provided by the'math' module, like the one I posted above.\n\nAnd what does 'try and don't fail' mean?", "def sum_to_n(n: int):\n    \"\"\"sum_to_n is a function that sums numbers from 1 to n.\n    >>> sum_to_n(30)\n    465\n    >>> sum_to_n(100)\n    5050\n    >>> sum_to_n(5)\n    15\n    >>> sum_to_n(10)\n    55\n    >>> sum_to_n(1)\n    1\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"", "def sum_to_n(n: int):\n    \"\"\"sum_to_n is a function that sums numbers from 1 to n.\n    >>> sum_to_n(30)\n    465\n    >>> sum_to_n(100)\n    5050\n    >>> sum_to_n(5)\n    15\n    >>> sum_to_n(10)\n    55\n    >>> sum_to_n(1)\n    1\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    a = 1\n    while n < 1:\n        a = a + sum_to_n(n - 1)\n        n += 1\n    return a\nThe assignment asks you to write the sum_to_n function, and you write it as above.

If we were to use sum_to_n in a situation where we need to sum integers, it will return an error.\nThe code is not just about making the sum function generic, it also allows us to extend sum_to_n so that it can sum numbers from 1 to any integer.\n\nI think you should put in an example of the same function, but with different parameters.\n\nDone, check it out.\n\nI don't think it's a good example. The sum_to_n function has a different type depending on the parameter. In your example, there's no type information, so you get an error.\nWhat the author is saying is that the method should look like this:", "def sum_to_n(n: int):\n    \"\"\"sum_to_n is a function that sums numbers from 1 to n.\n    >>> sum_to_n(30)\n    465\n    >>> sum_to_n(100)\n    5050\n    >>> sum_to_n(5)\n    15\n    >>> sum_to_n(10)\n    55\n    >>> sum_to_n(1)\n    1\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    def sum_to_n(n: int):\n    \"\"\"sum_to_n is a function that sums numbers from 1 to n.\n    >>> sum_to_n(1)\n    1\n    >>> sum_to_n(2)\n    3\n    >>> sum_to_n(3)\n    6\n    >>> sum_to_n(4)\n    9\n    >>> sum_to_n(5)\n    15\n    >>> sum_to_n(10)\n    55\n    >>> sum_to_n(100)\n    5050\n    >>> sum_to_n(1000)\n    50050\n    >>> sum_to_n(2)\n    3\n    >>> sum_to_n(2)\n    3\n    >>> sum_to_n(2)\n    3\n    \"\"\"\n    def sum_to_n(n: int):", "def sum_to_n(n: int):\n    \"\"\"sum_to_n is a function that sums numbers from 1 to n.\n    >>> sum_to_n(30)\n    465\n    >>> sum_to_n(100)\n    5050\n    >>> sum_to_n(5)\n    15\n    >>> sum_to_n(10)\n    55\n    >>> sum_to_n(1)\n    1\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"", "def sum_to_n(n: int):\n    \"\"\"sum_to_n is a function that sums numbers from 1 to n.\n    >>> sum_to_n(30)\n    465\n    >>> sum_to_n(100)\n    5050\n    >>> sum_to_n(5)\n    15\n    >>> sum_to_n(10)\n    55\n    >>> sum_to_n(1)\n    1\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return sum(1, n)\n\n>>> print sum_to_n(10)\n55\n\nIs this really a solution to the problem?\n\nThis solution is O(n) complexity, which is bad.

This is a problem.\n\nI was worried that sum_to_n was going to be a little too obvious :)\n\nMaybe it's just me, but that was a bit vague.\nI'd never seen Python's `sum` before, so I assumed `sum_to_n` was a Python built-in. That it was a function was obvious, but I didn't know what it was supposed to be doing. I tried using it with 10 and got something that looked like a list.\nI thought maybe it was supposed to be returning the number of digits it would take to display the number. So I tried \"sum_to_n(1.0)\". It returned \"6\". Then I tried \"sum_to_n(2.0)\". That returned \"8\". \"sum_to_n(3.0)\" returned \"10\".\nFinally I decided that I should just ask for help.

You can certainly do this sort of thing in Java, but it's a lot more verbose. In Java you might need to:\nfinal class Sum {\npublic static int sum(int a, int b) {", "def sum_to_n(n: int):\n    \"\"\"sum_to_n is a function that sums numbers from 1 to n.\n    >>> sum_to_n(30)\n    465\n    >>> sum_to_n(100)\n    5050\n    >>> sum_to_n(5)\n    15\n    >>> sum_to_n(10)\n    55\n    >>> sum_to_n(1)\n    1\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n\n\"Python for programmers\", 3rd ed.\n\nThanks for posting the Python 3 version.\n\nI've been doing some functional stuff in python lately, and I found myself using functional-style code in python when I would otherwise have used loops. In my experience, I often have to put a constraint on the input data, such as \"if the input is a list, and the first item is lower than the second item, then return 1\". In python, it's more efficient to have a function that does that, and I'd rather not use a loop.\n\nI have been doing some functional programming in python lately as well, and a similar thing is happening with me as well. I've been using generators to pass data around and do some functional programming and so on. It's really nice.\n\nI'm glad I wasn't the only one who did this.\n\nI'm just having flashbacks to my days with Visual Basic, where you'd have all sorts of user- defined functions to do stuff like this.\n\nThat's really cool.</s>"]]
