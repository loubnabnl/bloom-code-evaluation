When you sort a list, the order of the list is rearranged. This means that a list with the same values in different positions will be in a different order.\n\nIn the case of the list that you sort_even()ed, the list is ordered by the first element. The first element is 1. When you sort_even() the list, the first element is changed to 2. The second element is changed to 3.

I'd like to see some benchmarks, but I don't know how easy it is to benchmark this sort of thing.\n\nIt's worth using.\n\nI'm not sure I agree.\nIf you need to sort a list, you probably need to sort it as soon as possible, so that you can use it. If you need to sort a list that you don't have, you can't use this approach.\n\nIf you need to sort a list, you probably need to sort it as soon as possible, so that you can use it.

I've been seeing more and more people do this, and I'm wondering if there's a reason behind it.\n\nI don't know what the built-in range() does, but I'm guessing it's not what I'm doing. I'm taking the index of the first element in the range, subtracting 2, and using that as the index of the last element in the range.\n\nAh, I see.
