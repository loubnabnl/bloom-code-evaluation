I like the idea of the language, but it's hard to know how to code things without having example code to compare to.\n\nYou can sort arrays in js with:\nsort(myArray, function(a, b) {\nreturn a.split(' ');\n}).sort();\nThere are a number of ways to do it, but I've found this to be the most straightforward.\n\nWow, that's a really cool way of writing it. I always do:\nsort(myArray, function(a, b) {\nreturn a.sort(b);\n}).sort();\n\nPython style is to sort in place with the function as part of the sort() method.\n\nBut then, you get no performance boost from using a C extension (if you need it).\n\nThis seems like a bad idea.

The second one is really handy for quickly sorting a list.\n\nIf you use python, you can use the functools.lru_cache to save the result of the function so you can call it again:\n>>> def reverse_list(l):\n...    return l.sort()\n...    l = reverse_list(l)\n...    print l\n[2, 1, 0, 4, 3]\n>>> l.sort()\n>>> print l\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n>>> reverse_list(l)\n[2, 1, 0, 4, 3]\n\nThis is a great feature of Python.\n\nThis is so cool. Thanks so much for sharing it.\n\nI've got a feeling there's going to be a lot of surprise results from this\n\nI was hoping for a good excuse to use this:\n\nsort() does", "def sort_even(l: list):\n    \"\"\"This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that\n    l' is identical to l in the odd indicies, while its values at the even indicies are equal\n    to the values of the even indicies of l, but sorted.\n    >>> sort_even([1, 2, 3])\n    [1, 2, 3]\n    >>> sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4])\n    [3, 6, 5, 4]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    if l.count(2) == 0:\n        l = [0]\n    return [l[1:] + l[0]]\nYou want a more generic version of this.

Can someone explain?\n\nIt takes an array of numbers and sorts them from odd to even, with values of the evens kept in the same relative order as they were in the original array, and the values of the odd indices kept in the same relative order as they were in the original array, but in ascending order.\n\nIt's basically a way to ensure that you get the even indices in the correct order. Normally they'd be in ascending order, but when you sort in the traditional sense, they end up in descending order.\nThis function is saying \"the even indices should be in ascending order, and the odd indices should be in ascending order, but the even indices should be sorted by value from least to greatest, and the odd indices should be sorted from greatest to least\".\n\nThis is a good answer.

Sorting is simple to do, but very hard to get right. A lot of research has been done on this. For example, SORT algorithm () is based on an interesting observation. The paper is only 30 pages long.\n\nI think the real challenge with sorting is knowing when you're \"done\". I've often found myself in a situation where I've implemented a sort, but it's not the sort I want. The sort I want happens to be some kind of quicksort, but I have no idea.\n\nThis is actually a good point. A good strategy is to read research papers to learn about algorithms and the design tradeoffs, and then to read code to learn how to implement them.\n\nI have no doubt that the author can make a quicksort. He needs to learn some of the techniques of sorting to get it right. Here are a few techniques:\n1\\.

If I run it in IPython it seems to work, but if I think about it, I don't think it should work. The odd indices are in the odd positions, and the even indices are in the even positions. So why is it not sorted by the first two indices?  Or is this just a result of the sort function changing the order of the list?\nI think the indices are not indices but position of each value in the list. The problem is that the definition doesn't state if it is ascending or descending order. So if you use it on a list in ascending order, you get the original list in descending order.  edit: yeah you are right.

So you can say something like:\na, b = [1, 2, 3, 4],\nsort_even(a)\nb = [5, 6,", "def sort_even(l: list):\n    \"\"\"This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that\n    l' is identical to l in the odd indicies, while its values at the even indicies are equal\n    to the values of the even indicies of l, but sorted.\n    >>> sort_even([1, 2, 3])\n    [1, 2, 3]\n    >>> sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4])\n    [3, 6, 5, 4]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return l == l", "def sort_even(l: list):\n    \"\"\"This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that\n    l' is identical to l in the odd indicies, while its values at the even indicies are equal\n    to the values of the even indicies of l, but sorted.\n    >>> sort_even([1, 2, 3])\n    [1, 2, 3]\n    >>> sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4])\n    [3, 6, 5, 4]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    l = sorted(l)\n    return sorted(l[::2])\n\nAnd now for the non-obvious part.", "def sort_even(l: list):\n    \"\"\"This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that\n    l' is identical to l in the odd indicies, while its values at the even indicies are equal\n    to the values of the even indicies of l, but sorted.\n    >>> sort_even([1, 2, 3])\n    [1, 2, 3]\n    >>> sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4])\n    [3, 6, 5, 4]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return l.sort()\n\nThe original Python implementation of sort_even is in stdlib.sort.sort_even.", "def sort_even(l: list):\n    \"\"\"This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that\n    l' is identical to l in the odd indicies, while its values at the even indicies are equal\n    to the values of the even indicies of l, but sorted.\n    >>> sort_even([1, 2, 3])\n    [1, 2, 3]\n    >>> sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4])\n    [3, 6, 5, 4]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    def reverse_sort(l: list, odd_indices=True):\n    \"\"\"This function reverses the sort order of l, and returns l, but only if odd_indices is True.\n    >>> reverse_sort(sort_even([1, 2, 3]) #with odd_indices=True)\n    [2, 1, 3]\n    >>> reverse_sort([5, 6, 3, 4]) #without odd_indices=True)\n    [5, 4, 6, 3]\n    \"\"\"\n    if odd_indices:\n        l = sorted(l, key=lambda a, b: 0 if a < b else 1)\n        sorted(l, key=lambda a, b: a[0] if a < b else b[0]))\n    return sorted(l, key=lambda a, b: b[1] if a > b else a[1]))</s>", "def sort_even(l: list):\n    \"\"\"This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that\n    l' is identical to l in the odd indicies, while its values at the even indicies are equal\n    to the values of the even indicies of l, but sorted.\n    >>> sort_even([1, 2, 3])\n    [1, 2, 3]\n    >>> sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4])\n    [3, 6, 5, 4]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return [l[0] for l in l if l[0] in [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]]\n\nI'm amazed that you can get such a good result from such a simple algorithm.\n\nIt's not _that_ simple. It's using recursion and it has an _if_ statement. That's almost all of Python in one tiny function.\n\nYou can implement it without recursion by precomputing the answer for the first two elements, and then just popping them off the list and returning them, if you want to get rid of the recursion.\n\nWhat about the next item in the list?\n\nThis is a very nice example of using recursion. I like this approach, which emphasizes the problem as a recursion rather than a loop.\n\nThis is interesting:\n>>> def sort_odd(l: list):\n...    \"\"\"This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that\n...    l' is identical to l in the even indicies, while its values at the odd indicies are equal\n...    to the values of the odd indicies of l, but sorted.", "def sort_even(l: list):\n    \"\"\"This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that\n    l' is identical to l in the odd indicies, while its values at the even indicies are equal\n    to the values of the even indicies of l, but sorted.\n    >>> sort_even([1, 2, 3])\n    [1, 2, 3]\n    >>> sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4])\n    [3, 6, 5, 4]\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return (\n        return l.sort(key=lambda x, y: x % 2 == y, reverse=True)\n        #

Python is great for prototyping algorithms, but you will eventually run into one that you don't understand and you'll be stuck. If you try to read the code of this algorithm, you will learn very little about it.\n\nI completely disagree. You can learn an awful lot about algorithms by figuring out how to implement them in other languages. There's a very big difference between _learning_ and _memorizing_.\n\nI think there's a balance to be had here. Writing code without understanding it is a great way to learn how to use language features and libraries, but learning a language without learning the theory behind it can be dangerous.\n\nThese days, I only learn new languages by writing programs in them, so I'm inclined to say that I've learned a lot of theory (and programming in general) by coding programs in other languages.\n\nI agree with the GP.
