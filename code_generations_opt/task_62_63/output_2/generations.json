For example, you could just define a function that takes a list of coefficients and returns the derivative of that polynomial. You could then call this function with a list of coefficients, or you could call it with a list of coefficients and a list of polynomials.\n\nYeah, I think that's a good idea.

I think a list comprehension is the best way to write a function that takes a list and returns a list, or that takes a list and returns a function.
