The first element of the pair is a score, the second element is a guess. The \"match\" function compares a guess to a game.

If the purpose of your program is to solve a problem, then a list comprehension doesn't help you.\n\nActually I find list comprehensions more readable than the \"traditional\" imperative way of doing things. If you are writing a function that is only meant to be used in one place, you can probably get away with it.\n\nI don't know, the code in the example looks much more readable to me.\n\nI like the example, too, but you know what's really scary? I'm sure I've written (or at least seen) code exactly like the example without thinking about it.\n\nI'd like to add a few points.\nI like to use list comprehensions over for loops because", "def compare(game,guess):\n    \"\"\"I think we all remember that feeling when the result of some long-awaited\n    event is finally known.

The first array is sorted, so the second array is also sorted, and we can easily compare the elements. In an array of random numbers, this algorithm is O(n^2). In real-life datasets, it will be O(nlog(n)).\n\nThis is a great example.\nI was able to use the code with a small modification to return an array of the absolute difference. I then wrote a quick little python program that sorted the original array and ran the algorithm. This allowed me to verify that it was O(n log n) before doing the same with my real data.\n\nThis is a good one for an interview.

This is a symptom of the overall design of Python where newbies are protected from seeing a lot of the complexities and implementation details.

Comparing two arrays of integers to determine if they have the same length. This looks like it should be possible, but it's not. There are several such situations in Python where you can't do something that looks obvious to you. This is one of the major reasons why I like the language, but I still think it's a problem.\n2\\.

I do think it is interesting, though.\n\nI don't really see the point. The easiest way to avoid this would be to just not post the scores of the wrong guesses. That way the difference between the guess and the score is 0. If you insist on posting the wrong guesses, the simplest way to do this is to have a hash table mapping the index of the guess to the index of the correct answer. You'll have collisions if there are multiple wrong guesses for the same answer, but that's going to be the case in this problem anyway.\nOf course, if you insist on not doing this, this program is a decent solution. It's pretty clean and elegant, and it's certainly more portable than a hash table.\n\nI think I understand what you are saying", "def compare(game,guess):\n    \"\"\"I think we all remember that feeling when the result of some long-awaited\n    event is finally known.
