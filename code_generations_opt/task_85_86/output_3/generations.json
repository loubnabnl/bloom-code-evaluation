Since the index is odd, the element must be even, so you find it. Then, the next index is even, so you need to go up to the next odd index, which is 1.\n\nThanks, and congrats on the great answers :)\n\nThis looks a lot like the map function in Haskell.

The bug is subtle because it only affects values with even number of bits, and only in certain circumstances.\nHere's a program that demonstrates the bug, and then shows how to fix it.\n\n    import math\n\n    def add_even_odd(a, b):\n       if a[0] == b[0]:\n          return 2\n\n       return a + b\n\n    def main():\n       import odd_even\n       odd_even.add_even_odd(1, 1) == 2\n\n       odd_even.add_even_odd(2, 2) == 4\n\n       odd_even.add_even_odd(3, 3) == 6\n       odd_even.add_even_odd(3, 0) == 7", "def add(lst):\n    \"\"\"Given a non-empty list of integers lst. add the even elements that are at odd indices..\n\n\n    Examples:\n        add([4, 2, 6, 7]) ==> 2 \n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return (int(lst[i][j]) % 2) + 1\n\nI'm not sure I understand this.\n\nadd(a, b) is a function that adds a and b. The result is stored in a. If a is zero, the result is zero. If a is the empty list, the result is the empty list.\nThe function add(lst) adds the numbers in lst and stores the result in a. If lst is the empty list, the result is zero. If lst is the even numbers that are at odd indices, the result is the sum of the numbers in lst, which are 2, 6, and 7.\n\nAnother way of thinking about it: add(lst) is the integer that you get by doing (int(lst[i][j]) % 2) + 1.\n\nThis is an interesting way of representing addition. It doesn't require negative numbers to represent the negative integers.\n\nIt also eliminates the need for a separate sign bit, because you can have a negative number be the same as an unsigned positive number, and vice versa.\n\nI think it's a good idea to show people how to write the", "def add(lst):\n    \"\"\"Given a non-empty list of integers lst. add the even elements that are at odd indices..\n\n\n    Examples:\n        add([4, 2, 6, 7]) ==> 2 \n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return lst.pop(0)", "def add(lst):\n    \"\"\"Given a non-empty list of integers lst. add the even elements that are at odd indices..\n\n\n    Examples:\n        add([4, 2, 6, 7]) ==> 2 \n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return list(int(x+2) for x in lst)", "def add(lst):\n    \"\"\"Given a non-empty list of integers lst. add the even elements that are at odd indices..\n\n\n    Examples:\n        add([4, 2, 6, 7]) ==> 2 \n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n\n    return list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, lst))", "def add(lst):\n    \"\"\"Given a non-empty list of integers lst. add the even elements that are at odd indices..\n\n\n    Examples:\n        add([4, 2, 6, 7]) ==> 2 \n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n\n    list = lst\n    for i in range(2, len(list) - 1):\n       if list[i] == 0:\n           list[i] = list[i + 1]\n    return list\n\nThis is the best algorithm.
