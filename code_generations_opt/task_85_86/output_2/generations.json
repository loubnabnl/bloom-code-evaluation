Shifting the list by one is the same as adding the number to the end of the list.\n\nThat's not quite right. Shifting the list by one means taking the last item and moving it to the beginning. It's the same as adding the number to the front of the list.\n\nI'm pretty sure he meant \"shifting\" as in \"sorting a list of numbers.\"\n\nI think he meant \"shifting\" as in \"shifting a list of numbers by one position\".\n\nBut that's not what the code does. It doesn't add a number to the beginning of the list, it adds it to the end of the list.\n\nIt is a very common idiom in functional languages, that you can do \"shifting\" of lists, and the result is a new list with the elements shifted by some amount.\n\nI'm not sure what you're", "def add(lst):\n    \"\"\"Given a non-empty list of integers lst. add the even elements that are at odd indices..\n\n\n    Examples:\n        add([4, 2, 6, 7]) ==> 2 \n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return sum(lst) % 2", "def add(lst):\n    \"\"\"Given a non-empty list of integers lst. add the even elements that are at odd indices..\n\n\n    Examples:\n        add([4, 2, 6, 7]) ==> 2 \n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    for i in range(len(lst)):\n        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:\n           lst[i] = lst[i] + 1\n        return lst", "def add(lst):\n    \"\"\"Given a non-empty list of integers lst. add the even elements that are at odd indices..\n\n\n    Examples:\n        add([4, 2, 6, 7]) ==> 2 \n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n\n    def add_odd(lst):\n    \"\"\"Given a non-empty list of integers lst. add the odd elements that are at even indices..\n\n\n    Examples:\n        add([4, 2, 6, 7]) ==> 4 \n    \"\"\"\n    return lst.pop(0).pop(0) + lst.pop(1).pop(1)\n\nI've been doing this kind of thing in Perl for years.\nI was even able to do it in C before Perl was around.\n\nFor those who don't know, Python has a built-in list type, and it's a bit more powerful than Perl's.\n\nI'm not sure how this is more powerful than Perl's. It's just a little bit shorter.\n\nI was referring to the built-in list type, not the example.\n\nI'm curious, what is the built-in list type?\n\nA list is a series of items of the same type.
