Is it a\nreturn value from a function, or is it a value that can be used in an\nexpression?\n\nThe function returns a value that can be used in an expression.\n\nIt's a \"return value\" from the function.\n\nNo, it's not a return value from the function. It's a value that can\nbe used in an expression.\n\nBut it's a function! Functions return values!\n\nNo, they don't.\n\nWell, they do, but only in some programming languages.\n\nThe only languages that don't have functions that return values are\nlanguages like C and assembly.\n\nSo, what does it mean to \"return\" a value?\n\nIt means to return", "def x_or_y(n, x, y):\n    \"\"\"A simple program which should return the value of x if n is \n    a prime number and should return the value of y otherwise.\n\n    Examples:\n    for x_or_y(7, 34, 12) == 34\n    for x_or_y(15, 8, 5) == 5\n    \n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    if n == 2:\n        return x\n    return y\n\nx_or_y(10, 2, 3) == 10\nx_or_y(10, 2, 3) == 3\n\nThe problem is that it is not obvious that the above program will always\nreturn the value of x.
