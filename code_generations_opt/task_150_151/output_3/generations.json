Why does it get used instead of using the \"if\" statement, for example?\n\nBecause the 'if' statement uses a full conditional expression.

Maybe you are used to seeing functions that return a value. The first version of xor_or's function does not do this. There are many reasons why you might want a function to return a value. The most common is to allow the caller to use it, without having to call it again.\nIn python there are other ways to do this, such as by storing the function's result in a variable. This is the function in the second version.\n\nThanks for the explanation, I understand now :)\n\nIt's a rather trivial program; it just compares two numbers and returns the larger one if one of them is prime.\n\nAlso, because xor_or is a generator function, it can be used in a for loop to check if a number is prime.

Let's say you have a large file of prime numbers, maybe even a list of primes up to some large number.  How can you determine if a number is prime or not using a minimum of code?  The usual solution is to use the Sieve of Eratosthenes.  You can find the implementation at\n<a href=\"http://www.math.toronto.edu/sieve/\">http://www.math.toronto.edu/sieve/</a>\nand you can find other implementations on the web by using the search terms \"sieve of eratosthenes\"\nor \"prime number sieve\".
