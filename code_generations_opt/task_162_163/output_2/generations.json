The principle of not doing it is generally considered to be a good one.\nThe string_to_md5 function is not one of those places where you don't need to do something.\nI'm not sure I agree with that.

Why are you using the hex() function?  You should be using the hexdigest() function.\nBecause the string_to_md5() function is meant to be a one-liner.  In this case, you could use hexdigest(), but then you'd have to make the one-liner more complex.\nI'm sorry, but one-liners are *not* good programming practice.\nIt's not meant to be a one-liner that you're going to use in production code.  It's just meant to be a one-liner that you're going to use in an interview or something.    It's not meant to be a good programming practice, it's meant to be a quick and dirty way to do something.  It's a one-liner.  Not a one-liner that you're going to use in production code.\nIt's a one-liner that you're going to use in an interview, but it's bad practice.
