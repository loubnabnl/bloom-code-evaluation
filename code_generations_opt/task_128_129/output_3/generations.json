This is a general problem with Python, where, for some reason, they have the sum function defined in terms of a recursive call, instead of a loop.\n\nIf sum() is implemented in terms of a loop then you need to write a loop to calculate the sum of each row.\n\nYup. But in this case, the loop is just one iteration of the `sum` function, so there's no performance loss.\n\nYou", "def prod_signs(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    You are given an array arr of integers and you need to return\n    sum of magnitudes of integers multiplied by product of all signs\n    of each number in the array, represented by 1, -1 or 0.\n    Note: return None for empty arr.\n\n    Example:\n    >>> prod_signs([1, 2, 2, -4]) == -9\n    >>> prod_signs([0, 1]) == 0\n    >>> prod_signs([]) == None\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    def prod_signs_zeros(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    You are given an array arr of integers and you need to return\n    sum of magnitudes of integers multiplied by product of all signs\n    of each number in the array, represented by 1, -1 or 0.\n    Note: return None for empty arr.\n\n    Example:\n    >>> prod_signs_zeros([1, 2, 2, -4]) == -9\n    >>> prod_signs_zeros([0, 1]) == 0\n    >>> prod_signs_zeros([]) == None\n    \"\"\"\n    return [0, 1, -1]\n    return []\n    return [0, 1]\n    return [0, 0]", "def prod_signs(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    You are given an array arr of integers and you need to return\n    sum of magnitudes of integers multiplied by product of all signs\n    of each number in the array, represented by 1, -1 or 0.\n    Note: return None for empty arr.\n\n    Example:\n    >>> prod_signs([1, 2, 2, -4]) == -9\n    >>> prod_signs([0, 1]) == 0\n    >>> prod_signs([]) == None\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    sign = 0\n    for i in arr:\n        sign = sign + i.sign\n        if sign > 1:\n             sign *= -1\n             sign /= sign\n    return sign\n\nThat's the shortest one.\n\nIt's nice, but I prefer the version that makes use of builtin integer division/modulo operators, and the one that uses the conditional expression.\n\nI like the builtin division method, but the one with the conditional expression is a little trickier.\n\nYou can also do it with a list comprehension.\n\nPython 3.3:\n>>> prod_signs = [(x**2 for x in range(2,1)) | (x^2 if x in range(1,2) else x) for x in range(2,1)] >>> prod_signs == -9\n\nThe top answer is doing the wrong thing.

When dealing with non-commutative operations (such as multiplication) there is no such thing as \"concatenation of order\". In such a situation the meaning of the operators cannot be simply derived from their mathematical properties. It's similar to comparing \"3 * -4\" to \"-3 * 3\".\n\nSee, the problem is that the order of multiplication is always \"last\" in Python. You can't have a function that operates on two arrays in two different ways, where one order produces a different result from the other.\n\nWell you could have a function that operates on two arrays in two different ways, but the second array would be evaluated first. If you wanted to operate on both arrays simultaneously then you could use a list comprehension or an expression tree.\n\nAnother way is to use a reduce function.

Isn't this just a very convoluted way to write a loop?\n\nYes.\n\nThat is a very poor name.\n\nI'm not sure if you're joking.

I guess it's not that big of a deal, considering that the spec isn't guaranteed to be accurate.\n\nIt is a big deal. The spec is supposed to be a contract between the client and the library.\n\nSo how would you correct the spec, and what would the new test cases look like?\n\nA \"big deal\" in my book is something that would cause me to seriously reconsider using a library.\nI would prefer something like:", "def prod_signs(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    You are given an array arr of integers and you need to return\n    sum of magnitudes of integers multiplied by product of all signs\n    of each number in the array, represented by 1, -1 or 0.\n    Note: return None for empty arr.\n\n    Example:\n    >>> prod_signs([1, 2, 2, -4]) == -9\n    >>> prod_signs([0, 1]) == 0\n    >>> prod_signs([]) == None\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n         # x = 0, y = 1\n        # for each element in the array\n        for i in arr:\n            x = x * i\n           y = y * (1 if i == 0 else -1)\n            x = x + y\n            return sum(x) / float(len(arr))\n   \n    # 3.
