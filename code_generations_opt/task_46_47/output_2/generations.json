You can also use recursion.\n\nFor the stack, you can use a recursive stack, or you can use a queue and a stack to solve it.\nFor the queue, you can use a queue of n-1 elements, and a queue of n-2 elements. The queue of n-2 elements is used to store the results of the recursive calls to fib4. The queue of n-1 elements is used to store the results of the recursive calls to fib4(n-2).\nFor the recursive stack, you can use a stack of n-1 elements, and a stack of n-2 elements. The stack of n-2 elements is used to store the results of the recursive calls to fib4(n-2). The stack of n-1 elements is used to store the results of the recursive calls to fib4(n-1).\n\nThe recursive stack and queue are simpler and easier to read.</s>", "def fib4(n: int):\n    \"\"\"The Fib4 number sequence is a sequence similar to the Fibbonacci sequnece that's defined as follows:\n    fib4(0) -> 0\n    fib4(1) -> 0\n    fib4(2) -> 2\n    fib4(3) -> 0\n    fib4(n) -> fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4).\n    Please write a function to efficiently compute the n-th element of the fib4 number sequence.

It seems like it's just testing to see if you know how to write a recursive function.\n\nI think the point is that it's a very simple recursive function that can be used to illustrate the difference between Python and other languages.\n\nI'm not sure I'd call it a very simple recursive function. It's a Fibonacci function that, if you use it, will blow up in your face if you pass in a number that's not in the Fibonacci sequence.\nI'd call that an anti-pattern.\n\nI think it's a great question.
