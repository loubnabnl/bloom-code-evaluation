This method sorts a list of numbers in ascending order by the number of digits.  It can be used to sort lists of numbers, which have been stored in a computer system in a non-standard way.  For example, the numbers 1, 1.0, 2.0, and 2.0.0 are stored as a list in a computer system.  The first number in the list is stored as 1.  The second number in the list is stored as 1.0.  The third number in the list is stored as 2.0.  The fourth number in the list is stored as 2.0.0.  This method sorts these numbers in ascending order.\n\nSorting numbers by the number of digits\nThe number of digits of a number n is the number of non-zero digits in the decimal expansion of n.

[nums[i] for i in range(nums.size)]\n\nThis is the best algorithm I could come up with for sorting integers in\nascending order. It is based on the idea of writing a function which\nassigns to each number a value of the form (n+1) mod 10, where n is the\nnumber to be sorted. The function then sorts the numbers by the sum of\ntheir digits.\n\nThe algorithm can be expressed in terms of the following two functions:\n\n    def add_digit(n):\n        return n + 1\n    def add_mod_10(n):\n        return n % 10\n\nThe add_digit function adds one to the argument n, and the add_mod_10\nfunction returns n % 10, where 10 is the value of the modulus operator.\n\nHere is the algorithm:\n\n    def order_by_points(nums):\n        nums = [nums[0] for nums in range(nums.size)]", "def order_by_points(nums):\n    \"\"\"\n    Write a function which sorts the given list of integers\n    in ascending order according to the sum of their digits.\n    Note: if there are several items with similar sum of their digits,\n    order them based on their index in original list.\n\n    For example:\n    >>> order_by_points([1, 11, -1, -11, -12]) == [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11]\n    >>> order_by_points([]) == []\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return sorted(nums.items(), key=lambda n: sum(n.digits())[0])", "def order_by_points(nums):\n    \"\"\"\n    Write a function which sorts the given list of integers\n    in ascending order according to the sum of their digits.\n    Note: if there are several items with similar sum of their digits,\n    order them based on their index in original list.\n\n    For example:\n    >>> order_by_points([1, 11, -1, -11, -12]) == [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11]\n    >>> order_by_points([]) == []\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    def sum_of_digits(nums):\n    \"\"\"\n    Write a function which returns the sum of the digits of the given\n    list of integers in ascending order.\n    Note: if there are several items with similar sum of their digits,\n    order them based on their index in original list.\n    For example:\n    >>> sum_of_digits([1, 2, 3, 4]) == 10\n    >>> sum_of_digits([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == 14\n    >>> sum_of_digits([]) == 0\n    \"\"\"\n    return sum(nums[::-1])\n    def sort_by_sum_of_digits(nums):\n    \"\"\"\n    Write a function which sorts the given list of integers\n    in ascending order according to the sum of their digits.\n    Note: if there are several items with similar sum of their digits,\n    order them based on their index in original list.", "def order_by_points(nums):\n    \"\"\"\n    Write a function which sorts the given list of integers\n    in ascending order according to the sum of their digits.\n    Note: if there are several items with similar sum of their digits,\n    order them based on their index in original list.\n\n    For example:\n    >>> order_by_points([1, 11, -1, -11, -12]) == [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11]\n    >>> order_by_points([]) == []\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    sorted_nums = sorted(nums, key=lambda x: x[0], reverse=True)\n    for num in sorted_nums:\n        if num > 0:\n            num_sum = sum(digits(num))\n            sorted_nums = sorted(nums, key=lambda x: num_sum[x])\n    return sorted_nums", "def order_by_points(nums):\n    \"\"\"\n    Write a function which sorts the given list of integers\n    in ascending order according to the sum of their digits.\n    Note: if there are several items with similar sum of their digits,\n    order them based on their index in original list.\n\n    For example:\n    >>> order_by_points([1, 11, -1, -11, -12]) == [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11]\n    >>> order_by_points([]) == []\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    if nums[0] == 0:\n        return [0]\n    else:\n        return sorted(nums, key=lambda x: x[0], reverse=True)", "def order_by_points(nums):\n    \"\"\"\n    Write a function which sorts the given list of integers\n    in ascending order according to the sum of their digits.\n    Note: if there are several items with similar sum of their digits,\n    order them based on their index in original list.\n\n    For example:\n    >>> order_by_points([1, 11, -1, -11, -12]) == [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11]\n    >>> order_by_points([]) == []\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return [x for x in nums if x[0] > x[1] for x in range(nums.size())]", "def order_by_points(nums):\n    \"\"\"\n    Write a function which sorts the given list of integers\n    in ascending order according to the sum of their digits.\n    Note: if there are several items with similar sum of their digits,\n    order them based on their index in original list.\n\n    For example:\n    >>> order_by_points([1, 11, -1, -11, -12]) == [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11]\n    >>> order_by_points([]) == []\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return sorted(nums.items(), key=lambda x: x[1] -
