For all entries in the list, the function shall square the integer entry if its index is a \n    multiple of 3 and will cube the integer entry if its index is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3. The function will not \n    change the entries in the list whose indexes are not a multiple of 3 or 4. The function shall then return the sum of all entries. \n    \n    Examples:\n    For lst = [1,2,3] the output should be 6\n    For lst = []  the output should be 0\n    For lst = [-1,-5,2,-1,-5]  the output should be -126\n    \"\"\"\n    sum = 0\n    for i in lst:\n        if i%3 == 0:\n            sum += i**2\n        elif i%4 == 0:\n            sum += i**3\n        else:\n            sum += i\n    return sum"]]
