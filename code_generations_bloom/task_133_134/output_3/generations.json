This allows to keep a clear and simple structure. It is very readable and easy to understand, and it is also easy to write tests for.\nOne thing I would improve is the rounding of numbers. There is already a built-in function for that: int(ceil(x)). This way, the ceil function can be simplified to just return the input, which removes a layer of indentation and reduces the number of lines of code. Also, the range in the for loop is very likely not necessary, and can be replaced by a simple for element in lst. Finally, I would avoid putting spaces in line comments (single-lined comments).\nimport math", "def sum_squares(lst):\n    \"\"\"You are given a list of numbers.\n    You need to return the sum of squared numbers in the given list,\n    round each element in the list to the upper int(Ceiling) first.\n    Examples:\n    For lst = [1,2,3] the output should be 14\n    For lst = [1,4,9] the output should be 98\n    For lst = [1,3,5,7] the output should be 84\n    For lst = [1.4,4.2,0] the output should be 29\n    For lst = [-2.4,1,1] the output should be 6\n    \n\n    \"\"\"\n    lst = [ round(x,0) for x in lst ]\n    res = sum([ x**2 for x in lst ])\n    return res", "def sum_squares(lst):\n    \"\"\"You are given a list of numbers.\n    You need to return the sum of squared numbers in the given list,\n    round each element in the list to the upper int(Ceiling) first.\n    Examples:\n    For lst = [1,2,3] the output should be 14\n    For lst = [1,4,9] the output should be 98\n    For lst = [1,3,5,7] the output should be 84\n    For lst = [1.4,4.2,0] the output should be 29\n    For lst = [-2.4,1,1] the output should be 6\n    \n\n    \"\"\"\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(len(lst)):\n        total += lst[i]*lst[i]\n\n    return round(total)", "def sum_squares(lst):\n    \"\"\"You are given a list of numbers.\n    You need to return the sum of squared numbers in the given list,\n    round each element in the list to the upper int(Ceiling) first.\n    Examples:\n    For lst = [1,2,3] the output should be 14\n    For lst = [1,4,9] the output should be 98\n    For lst = [1,3,5,7] the output should be 84\n    For lst = [1.4,4.2,0] the output should be 29\n    For lst = [-2.4,1,1] the output should be 6\n    \n\n    \"\"\"\n    for i in range(len(lst)):\n        lst[i] = lst[i] + round(lst[i], 0)\n    return sum(lst)**2", "def sum_squares(lst):\n    \"\"\"You are given a list of numbers.\n    You need to return the sum of squared numbers in the given list,\n    round each element in the list to the upper int(Ceiling) first.\n    Examples:\n    For lst = [1,2,3] the output should be 14\n    For lst = [1,4,9] the output should be 98\n    For lst = [1,3,5,7] the output should be 84\n    For lst = [1.4,4.2,0] the output should be 29\n    For lst = [-2.4,1,1] the output should be 6\n    \n\n    \"\"\"\n    #
