You can replace that with a simple for-loop in a generator comprehension or map.\nIn your code you have defined your function twice. The first definition is never used, so you can remove it.\nThe if n % 2 == 0 else n * fact(n - 1) is a Python specific syntax. In other languages you would have to write (n % 2 == 0)? n * fact(n - 1) : n * fact(n - 1).\nYou don't need to use range(1, n) for the same reason.\nIf you don't have any intention to use this code in Python 3, you can simplify your code using xrange(1, n) instead of range(1, n), since in Python 2 range will return an actual list.\n\nI would refactor the code to:", "def f(n):\n    \"\"\" Implement the function f that takes n as a parameter,\n    and returns a list of size n, such that the value of the element at index i is the factorial of i if i is even\n    or the sum of numbers from 1 to i otherwise.\n    i starts from 1.\n    the factorial of i is the multiplication of the numbers from 1 to i (1 * 2 * ... * i).\n    Example:\n    f(5) == [1, 2, 6, 24, 15]\n    \"\"\"    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    else:\n        return [_f(i) for i in range(1, n + 1)]", "def f(n):\n    \"\"\" Implement the function f that takes n as a parameter,\n    and returns a list of size n, such that the value of the element at index i is the factorial of i if i is even\n    or the sum of numbers from 1 to i otherwise.\n    i starts from 1.\n    the factorial of i is the multiplication of the numbers from 1 to i (1 * 2 * ... * i).\n    Example:\n    f(5) == [1, 2, 6, 24, 15]\n    \"\"\"", "def f(n):\n    \"\"\" Implement the function f that takes n as a parameter,\n    and returns a list of size n, such that the value of the element at index i is the factorial of i if i is even\n    or the sum of numbers from 1 to i otherwise.\n    i starts from 1.\n    the factorial of i is the multiplication of the numbers from 1 to i (1 * 2 * ... * i).\n    Example:\n    f(5) == [1, 2, 6, 24, 15]\n    \"\"\"    l = []\n    if n > 0:\n        i = 1\n        while i <= n:\n            if i % 2 == 0:\n                l.append(factorial(i))\n            else:\n                l.append(sum(range(1, i)))\n            i += 1\n    return l", "def f(n):\n    \"\"\" Implement the function f that takes n as a parameter,\n    and returns a list of size n, such that the value of the element at index i is the factorial of i if i is even\n    or the sum of numbers from 1 to i otherwise.\n    i starts from 1.\n    the factorial of i is the multiplication of the numbers from 1 to i (1 * 2 * ... * i).\n    Example:\n    f(5) == [1, 2, 6, 24, 15]\n    \"\"\"    a = []\n    if n == 0:\n        return a\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        a.append(1)\n        for i in range(2, n + 1):\n            a.append(a[i -
