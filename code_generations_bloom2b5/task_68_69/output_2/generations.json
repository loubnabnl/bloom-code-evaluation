nodes with the same smallest even value are found return the node that has smallest index.\n\n    The plucked node should be returned in a list, [ smalest_value, its index ],\n    If there are no even values or the given array is empty, return [].\n\n    Example 1:\n        Input: [4,2,3]\n        Output: [2, 1]\n        Explanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2 has the smallest index.\n\n    Example 2:\n        Input: [1,2,3]\n        Output: [2, 1]\n        Explanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2 has the smallest index. \n\n    Example 3:\n        Input: []\n        Output: []\n    \n    Example 4:\n        Input: [5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]\n        Output: [0, 1]\n        Explanation: 0 is the smallest value, but  there are two zeros,\n                     so we will choose the first zero, which has the smallest index.\n\n    Constraints:\n        * 1 <= nodes.length <= 10000\n        * 0 <= node.value\n    \"\"\"\n\n    if len(arr) == 0:\n        return []\n    if len(arr) % 2 == 0:\n        return pluck(arr[:])\n    if len(arr) == 1:\n        return arr[:]\n    if arr[0] < arr[1]:\n        return pluck(arr[:])\n    return pluck(arr[:] + [arr[0], 1])"]]
