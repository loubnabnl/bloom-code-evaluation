number of elements in the array that are greater than 10 and both \n    first and last digits of a number are odd (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).\n    For example:\n    specialFilter([15, -73, 14, -15]) => 1 \n    specialFilter([33, -2, -3, 45, 21, 109]) => 2\n    \"\"\"\n    nums = sorted(nums)\n    nums.reverse()\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(len(nums)):\n        if (nums[i] > 10) and (nums[i] % 2!= 0):\n            count += 1\n        else:\n            count += 0\n\n    return count"]]
