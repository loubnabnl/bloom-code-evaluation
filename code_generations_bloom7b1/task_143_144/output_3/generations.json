Argument: a sentence\n\nThe basic idea is to use the fact that the length of the longest word in a sentence is always a prime number. The shortest such word must be of length 1, as the sentence is not empty. The longest word has length L. The first L-1 words must be of the length of the longest word. The remaining word can only be a prime number of length L.\nWhen we take the shortest such word of length 1, we get that the sentence must be \"This is a test\".
