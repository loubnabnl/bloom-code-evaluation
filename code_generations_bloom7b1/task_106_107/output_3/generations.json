A recursive function like this one would normally take an extra parameter, which is the value of the function.\nThis can be solved with the lambda expression. You take a variable that gets assigned to the value of the function, which in this case is the list.\nHere the value of the function is calculated by assigning the result of a statement to a variable, and then the statement is executed.\nThat's how it works in recursion. We have to make the statement take the value of the function as a parameter in this case, and then we can use the same logic as in recursion: we assign the result of the statement to a variable, and then we have to execute the statement with the given value.\nThat's why i%2 is used in the", "def f(n):\n    \"\"\" Implement the function f that takes n as a parameter,\n    and returns a list of
