You could do this with a simple loop over the first three items of the string. In order to determine if the string is an empty string or if it contains just one item, use the string.count(item) function. To find the number of apples, just use the string.count('apples') function. To find the number of oranges, just use the string.count('oranges'). These functions are explained in Python's documentation.\nFor example:\n>>> fruit_distribution(\"5", "def fruit_distribution(s,n):\n    \"\"\"\n    In this task, you will be given a string that represents a number of apples and oranges \n    that are distributed in a basket of fruit this basket contains \n    apples, oranges, and mango fruits.
