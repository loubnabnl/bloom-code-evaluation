The reason for this is that we can use the\n    # bucket capacities of all wells to calculate the capacity of each\n    # bucket. This is very efficient because the bucket capacities are\n    # stored in the buckets, so we can reuse the buckets for", "def max_fill(grid, capacity):\n    import math\n    \"\"\"\n    You are given a rectangular grid of wells.
