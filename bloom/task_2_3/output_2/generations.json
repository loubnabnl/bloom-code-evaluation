So this is equivalent to:\n>>> print float(3.5)\n0.5\n\nYes.\n\nI like this better:", "def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:\n    \"\"\" Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into\n    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals\n    (leftover part always smaller than 1).\n\n    Return the decimal part of the number.\n    >>> truncate_number(3.5)\n    0.5\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"", "def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:\n    \"\"\" Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into\n    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals\n    (leftover part always smaller than 1).\n\n    Return the decimal part of the number.\n    >>> truncate_number(3.5)\n    0.5\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return float(number)\nThis is not Pythonic.\n\nHow so?\n\nThe first line is not a one-liner.\n\nI think the first line is a one-liner, but not a one-liner _program_. It's a one-liner _function_.\n\nI'm a little confused as to why the first line isn't a one-liner. I'd be happy to change it if you could explain.\n\nA one-liner is a function that has a single line of code in it.\n\nAh, I see. I don't think I can make it a one-liner, but I'll try.\n\nI'm curious to know if it's possible to write a one-liner with no indentation?\n\nNo, indentation is required to make the code readable.\n\nYou can use the following trick:", "def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:\n    \"\"\" Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into\n    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals\n    (leftover part always smaller than 1).\n\n    Return the decimal part of the number.\n    >>> truncate_number(3.5)\n    0.5\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"", "def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:\n    \"\"\" Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into\n    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals\n    (leftover part always smaller than 1).\n\n    Return the decimal part of the number.\n    >>> truncate_number(3.5)\n    0.5\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n\nI'd prefer to see this implemented in terms of the __int__ and __float__ methods.\n\nI'm not sure if I'm missing something, but isn't this the same as:\n>>> from decimal import Decimal\n>>> Decimal(3.5)\n3.5\n\nYes, but it's a little more readable to me, and I think it's more clear that this is not a string-based solution.\n\nI don't know about \"more readable\", but it's certainly more idiomatic.\n\nI think this is a nice example of how one can use Python to implement things in a domain-specific way.\n\nI like it. I've seen a couple of times where I needed this, and it's nice to have a clean, easy way to do it.\n\nThis is a bit of a hack but if you want to get the same result with a little less typing, you can use the following:\n>>> from decimal import Decimal\n>>> Decimal(3.5)\n3.5\n>>> from decimal import Decimal\n>>> Decimal(float(3.5))\n0.5\n\nI prefer the one liner.\n>>> from decimal import Dec", "def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:\n    \"\"\" Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into\n    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals\n    (leftover part always smaller than 1).\n\n    Return the decimal part of the number.\n    >>> truncate_number(3.5)\n    0.5\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    if number is not None:\n        return float(number)\n    else:\n        return float(number / 1.0)\n\nI think this is a great example of why you should always use python3.\n\nNot really, because truncate_number is in the standard library.\n\nI'm not sure why that's relevant.\n\nIt's not, I thought you were saying that you should use python3 because of the new syntax for the same feature.\n\nI'm not sure why that's relevant.\n\nIt's not, I thought you were saying that you should use python3 because of the new syntax for the same feature.\n\nThis is a good example of why you should always use python3.\n\nNot really, because truncate_number is in the standard library.\n\nI'm not sure why that's relevant.\n\nIt's not, I thought you were saying that you should use python3 because of the new syntax for the same feature.\n\nI'm not sure why that's relevant.\n\nIt's not, I thought you were saying that you should use python3 because of", "def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:\n    \"\"\" Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into\n    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals\n    (leftover part always smaller than 1).\n\n    Return the decimal part of the number.\n    >>> truncate_number(3.5)\n    0.5\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"", "def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:\n    \"\"\" Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into\n    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals\n    (leftover part always smaller than 1).\n\n    Return the decimal part of the number.\n    >>> truncate_number(3.5)\n    0.5\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"", "def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:\n    \"\"\" Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into\n    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals\n    (leftover part always smaller than 1).\n\n    Return the decimal part of the number.\n    >>> truncate_number(3.5)\n    0.5\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"", "def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:\n    \"\"\" Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into\n    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals\n    (leftover part always smaller than 1).\n\n    Return the decimal part of the number.\n    >>> truncate_number(3.5)\n    0.5\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"", "def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:\n    \"\"\" Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into\n    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals\n    (leftover part always smaller than 1).\n\n    Return the decimal part of the number.\n    >>> truncate_number(3.5)\n    0.5\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"", "def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:\n    \"\"\" Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into\n    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals\n    (leftover part always smaller than 1).\n\n    Return the decimal part of the number.\n    >>> truncate_number(3.5)\n    0.5\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n\nI'm not sure what you're trying to accomplish with this, but you can achieve the same effect by using the float division operator, which is designed for exactly this purpose.</s>", "def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:\n    \"\"\" Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into\n    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals\n    (leftover part always smaller than 1).\n\n    Return the decimal part of the number.\n    >>> truncate_number(3.5)\n    0.5\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n\nThe truncate_number function is a case where the C style casts are perfectly valid.\n\nFor example, in python:\n>>> 3.5.decimal\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nTypeError: 'float' object does not support item assignment\n\nIn C:\n>>> 3.5.decimal\n0.5\n>>> 3.5.truncate(3)\n0.5\n\nI'm not sure what the problem is here.\n\nYou are using the C-style casts, which are perfectly valid, and the python code is complaining.

The second is that it's too long for a one-liner that anyone will ever want to type. The third is that it's a hack. The fourth is that it's a hack that doesn't do what it's supposed to do.\n\nIt's too long to type because it's too long.\n\nIt's a hack because it relies on a behavior that's not guaranteed by the language. The language guarantees that the integer part of the number will be returned, but it doesn't guarantee that the decimal part will be there.\n\nIt doesn't do what it's supposed to do because it returns the integer part, but only if the integer part is less than the number. If it's more than the number, it returns the decimal part, but only if the decimal part is less than 1.\n\nSo it's a hack that doesn't do what it's supposed to do.\n\nThe best solution to this problem is to use a library. For example, numpy.ndarray can do this with a single line of code:\n\nn", "def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:\n    \"\"\" Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into\n    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals\n    (leftover part always smaller than 1).\n\n    Return the decimal part of the number.\n    >>> truncate_number(3.5)\n    0.5\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return float(number) / float(number)\n\nThis is a good example of why I don't like using floating point numbers in Python.\n\nI have a somewhat related question: What is the best way to get a decimal from a floating point number?\nI've found that most of the time you can just divide the float by 10, but sometimes you end up with a float that is a fractional multiple of 10. For example, if you try to get the decimal of the number 5.5 you end up with the float 0.05, which is not a whole number.\n\nTo get the decimal of 5.5 you have to truncate to the nearest integer.\n>>> print truncate_number(5.5)\n0.5\n>>> print truncate_number(5.5, 2)\n1\n>>> print truncate_number(5.5, 1)\n0.5\n\nThat's not right. Truncate_number returns the decimal portion of the number, not the integer portion. So if you have a number like 5.5, the result is 0.5.\n\nThat's right, I misread the code.\n\nAnother way of", "def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:\n    \"\"\" Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into\n    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals\n    (leftover part always smaller than 1).\n\n    Return the decimal part of the number.\n    >>> truncate_number(3.5)\n    0.5\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return float(number[::-1])\n\nThat's not an exact solution.

The Python documentation for float has the following to say about truncating a float:\n\nThis function is similar to the one in the C programming language. It\nreturns the fractional part of a floating-point number, ignoring any\nexponent.\n\nNote that it returns the fractional part, not the decimal part.\n\nIn fact, the way you wrote your function is the way you would write it in C if you were using it as a function.\n\nNote that the C function truncate is defined as follows:\n\nint truncate(float x);\n\nThis is the way you would write it if you were using it as a function in C.\n\n--\nMats\n\nOn 6/18/07, David Radusin <radusin@gmail.com> wrote:\n>\n> I'm trying to write a function that will truncate a number to the\n> nearest integer.\n>\n> The documentation for float says that the function truncate_number()\n> will do this, but it doesn't seem to be the case.\n>\n> When I", "def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:\n    \"\"\" Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into\n    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals\n    (leftover part always smaller than 1).\n\n    Return the decimal part of the number.\n    >>> truncate_number(3.5)\n    0.5\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"", "def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:\n    \"\"\" Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into\n    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals\n    (leftover part always smaller than 1).\n\n    Return the decimal part of the number.\n    >>> truncate_number(3.5)\n    0.5\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n\n>>>", "def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:\n    \"\"\" Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into\n    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals\n    (leftover part always smaller than 1).\n\n    Return the decimal part of the number.\n    >>> truncate_number(3.5)\n    0.5\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n    return float(number) / 10**(-1)\n\nJust in case anyone doesn't know, this is the correct way to do this.\n\nI think the correct way to do this is to use the decimal module:\n>>> import decimal\n>>> decimal.decimal(3.5)\n0.5\n\nI would also have accepted:\n>>> from decimal import Decimal\n>>> Decimal(3.5)\n0.5\n\nI'm sure there's a joke about the difference between the two in here somewhere.\n\n\"We have the technology to build the world's first decimal module, and we\nshould.\"\n\nIt's not really a joke. Decimal is a module that can do arbitrary precision\narithmetic. It's very useful.\n\nI'm not sure that's really true. From the documentation:\n\"\"\" Decimal is a module that provides arbitrary precision arithmetic. It\nis based on the decimal arithmetic of the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic\nLibrary (GMP). It uses GMP's fast binary floating point support, and is\ntherefore much faster than the built-in decimal module.\n\"\"\"\n\nYes, I know.

It would be called \"trunc\" or something, and it would take a function and a value and return the value.\nIt would be like:\ntrunc(func, value)\nfunc(value)\nIt would be a lot more useful than this, because you could do things like\ntrunc(min, value)\ntrunc(max, value)\ntrunc(max, value)\nIt would be really useful for dealing with a lot of values.\n\nI'm not sure what you mean by \"not just numbers\", but you can already do this with arbitrary values using the map() function.\nmap(func, values)\nfunc(value)\n\nI'm not sure how it's possible to write", "def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:\n    \"\"\" Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into\n    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals\n    (leftover part always smaller than 1).\n\n    Return the decimal part of the number.\n    >>> truncate_number(3.5)\n    0.5\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\n\nThis is fine as a \"truncate\" function, but it's not a \"truncate_number\" function.\n\nI would call it \"decimal_part\".\n\nIt's a common convention that the name of the function should describe the return type, not the input.\n\nI don't see any reason why the name of the function should describe the return type.\n\nIt makes it easier to understand what the function does.
